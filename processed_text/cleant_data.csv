They do to!,m
I hope so.,?
She okay?,m
Let's go.,?
Wow,m
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.,?
No,m
"I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this ""persona""?  And you don't know how to quit?",?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?,?
"The ""real you"".",m
What good stuff?,?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.,m
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...,m
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like_ boring myself.,?
What crap?,m
do you listen to this crap?,?
No...,m
"Then Guillermo says_ ""If you go any lighter_ you're gonna look like an extra on 90210.""",?
You always been this selfish?,m
But,?
Then that's all you had to say.,m
Well_ no...,?
You never wanted to go out with 'me_ did you?,m
I was?,?
"I looked for you back at the party_ but you always seemed to be ""occupied"".",m
Tons,?
Have fun tonight?,m
I believe we share an art instructor,m
You know Chastity?,?
Looks like things worked out tonight_ huh?,m
Hi.,?
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.,?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?,m
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers_ so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.,?
She's not a...,m
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.,m
I really_ really_ really wanna go_ but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.,?
Sure have.,m
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never_ ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.,?
How do you get your hair to look like that?,m
You're sweet.,?
You have my word.  As a gentleman,m
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?,?
You got something on your mind?,m
Where?,?
There.,m
Well_ there's someone I think might be --,m
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?,?
Forget French.,?
That's because it's such a nice one.,m
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.,?
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.,m
C'esc ma tete. This is my head,?
Let me see what I can do.,m
Gosh_ if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...,?
That's a shame.,m
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school_ then it was just like she got sick of it or something.,?
Why?,m
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...,m
The thing is_ Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.,?
Cameron.,m
No_ no_ it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---,?
Forget it.,m
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?,?
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?,m
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.,?
Well_ I thought we'd start with pronunciation_ if that's okay with you.,m
Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.,?
I did.,?
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?,?
I don't have to be home 'til two.,?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.,?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.,?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with_ you know?,?
Bianca_ I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.,?
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...,?
Is he oily or dry?,?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all_ but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.,?
Would you mind getting me a drink_ Cameron?,?
Great,?
Joey.,?
Who?,?
Where did he go?  He was just here.,?
You might wanna think about it,?
No.,?
Did you change your hair?,?
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --,?
Listen_ I want to talk to you about the prom.,m
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.,m
Hi_ Joey.,?
Hey_ sweet cheeks.,m
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.,m
Neat...,?
It's a gay cruise line_ but I'll be_ like_ wearing a uniform and stuff.,m
Queen Harry?,?
"So yeah_ I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig "" that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.",m
Hopefully.,?
Exactly  So_ you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?,m
Expensive?,?
It's more,m
Perm?,f
Patrick -- is that- a.,?
It's just you.,f
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?,?
No! I just wanted,?
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?,f
I just wanted --,?
You set me up.,f
Let go!,?
So did you,f
You looked beautiful last night_ you know.,?
I guess I'll never know_ will I?,?
Not all experiences are good_ Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.,f
God_ you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark_ so I can't experience anything for myself,?
I guess I thought I was protecting you.,f
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.,?
That's not,f
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions_ you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.,?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.,f
Why didn't you tell me?,?
"After that_ I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party_ and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --",f
But,?
Just once.  Afterwards_ I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.,f
You did what?,?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.,f
As in...,?
Now I do.  Back then_ was a different story.,f
But you hate Joey,?
He was_ like_ a total babe,f
Why?,?
In 9th.  For a month,f
What?,?
Joey never told you we went out_ did he?,f
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go_ because you won ' t.,?
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons_ not someone else ' s .,f
Like you care.,?
Listen_ I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.,f
You're welcome.,f
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this_ and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.,?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.,?
Bianca_ I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --,f
Can we go now?,f
You are so completely unbalanced.,?
Yeah_ he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out_ I should obsess over a dead guy_ too.,?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?,f
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.,?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.,f
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?,?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal_ but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.,?
What's normal?,f
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal_ I can't be normal.,?
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.,?
What do you think?,f
Oh_ I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask_ but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?,?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.,f
Oh my God_ does this mean you're becoming normal?,?
Can you at least start wearing a bra?,?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.,f
Nowhere... Hi_ Daddy.,?
Where've you been?,f
I have a date_ Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.,?
I'm missing something.,m
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!,?
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.,m
"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is.",?
It's that hot rod Joey_ right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?,m
No_ but,?
The prom?  Kat has a date?,m
Daddy_ I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --,?
Because she'll scare them away.,m
Why?,?
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.,m
Just for a minute,m
Daddy_ no!,?
Wear the belly before you go.,m
It's just a party. Daddy.,?
Oh_ God.  It's starting.,m
If Kat's not going_ you're not going.,m
Daddy_ people expect me to be there!,?
"It's just a party. Daddy_ but I knew you'd forbid me to go since ""Gloria Steinem"" over there isn't going --",?
Otherwise known as an orgy?,m
If you must know_ we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.,?
And where're you going?,m
Daddy_ I --,?
Exactly my point,m
But she doesn't want to date.,?
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant_ Daddy!,?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.,m
What if she never starts dating?,?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.,m
Now don't get upset. Daddy_ but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...,?
Just sent 'em through.,?
Padua girls.  One tall_ decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?,m
Never,?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?,m
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?,?
Always a pleasure_ Brucie.,m
Best case scenario_ you're back on the payroll for awhile.,m
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.,m
No_ I ' m not.,m
Buttholus extremus.  But hey_ you're making progress.,m
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?,m
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.,m
Hell_ I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -,m
You told me that part already.,m
It's her favorite band.,m
Assail your ears for one night.,m
Okay!  I wasn't sure,m
He's pretty!,m
Dead at forty-one.,m
Her favorite uncle,m
It's a lung cancer issue,m
Number one.  She hates smokers,m
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.,m
Will Bogey get bent?,m
In that case_ we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.,m
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.,m
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle_ you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots_ and while he's busy setting up the plan_ you have time to woo Bianca.,m
You got him involved?,m
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.,m
I thought you hated those people.,m
You know_ if you do go out with Bianca_ you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.,m
That's what I just said,m
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?,m
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?,m
I'm serious_ man_ he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.,m
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?,m
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...,m
He seems like he thrives on danger,m
What makes you think he'll do it?,m
You wanna go out with him?,m
What about him?,m
Unlikely_ but even so_ she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?,m
I teach her French_ get to know her_ dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.,m
The mewling_ rampalian wretch herself.,m
That's her?  Bianca's sister?,m
Yeah_ just a minor encounter with the shrew.,m
You could consecrate with her_ my friend.,m
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?,m
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?,m
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada,m
You know French?,m
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron_ but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff_ but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.,m
He always have that shit-eating grin?,m
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that_ and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.,m
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?,m
I could start with your haircut_ but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.,m
Why not?,m
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it,m
Who is she?,m
You burn_ you pine_ you perish?,m
That girl -- I --,m
Yeah_ but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.,m
That I'm used to.,m
Couple thousand. Most of them evil,m
How many people go here?,m
Get out!,m
Thirty-two.,m
How many people were in your old school?,m
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows_ though.,m
I was kidding. People actually live there?,m
North_ actually.  How'd you   ?,m
So -- which Dakota you from?,m
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.,m
So they tell me...,m
You the new guy?,m
You get the girl.,m
What's the worst?,m
Where?,m
She kissed me.,m
You makin' any headway?,m
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.,m
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote,m
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.,m
What'd you do to her?,m
Then_ go get her,m
Sure,m
Cameron -- do you like the girl?,m
She's partial to Joey_ not me,m
What 're you talking about?,m
It's off. The whole thing.,m
Cameron_ I'm a little busy,m
Don't make me do it_ man,m
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.,m
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?,m
"Okay -- Likes:  Thai food_ feminist prose_ and ""angry_ stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion"".",m
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.,m
What've you got for me?,m
Yeah -- we'll see.,m
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.,m
And why would I do that?,m
Leave my sister alone.,f
Your sister here?,m
Away.,f
Where ya goin?,m
Not at all,m
Hey -- do you mind?,f
They're running the rest of me next month.,m
Yeah_ and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.,f
The vintage look is over_ Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?,m
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.,m
I don't know_ Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --,m
Get her to act like a human,m
Do what?,m
How'd you do it?,m
A deal's a deal.,m
It's about time.,m
Forget her sister_ then.,m
Forget it.,m
A hundred bucks a date.,m
What?,m
I just upped my price,m
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.,m
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.,m
I'm on it,m
When I shell out fifty_ I expect results.,m
Fifty_ and you've got your man.,m
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.,m
Fine_ thirty.,m
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.,m
How much?,m
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.,m
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?,m
You got it_ Verona.  I pick up the tab_ you do the honors.,m
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?,m
You need money to take a girl out,m
You just said,m
Sure_ Sparky.  I'll get right on it.,m
Yeah_ whatever.  I want you to go out with her.,m
Two legs_ nice rack...,m
What do you think?,m
Yeah,m
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?,m
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.,m
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.,m
You and Verona?,m
Uh_  yeah.  We're old friend*,m
I hear you're helpin' Verona.,m
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.,m
Does this conversation have a purpose?,m
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?,m
We're not.,m
Well_ actually_ I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know_ just to see if you're interested.,m
We don't chat.,m
Nope - just came by to chat,m
Are you lost?,m
Hey.,m
Oh_ honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.,f
William - he asked me to meet him here.,f
Who?,f
Have you seen him?,f
Oh_ good.  Something new and different for us.,f
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.,f
Okay_ okay_ we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway,f
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty_ all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.,f
Well_ I guess we're not_ since we don't have dates .,f
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?,f
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.,f
You didn't,f
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.,f
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?,f
I didn't have a choice.,f
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.,f
Who cares?,f
What'd he say?,f
No fear.,f
You think this'll work?,f
"If I was Bianca_ it would be_ ""Any school you want_ precious.  Don't forget your tiara.""",f
Does it matter?,f
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death_ but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?,f
Neither has his heterosexuality.,f
That's never been proven,f
William didn't even go to high school,f
William would never have gone to a state school.,f
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated_ puking frat boy_ number one golf team school. I have no say at all.,f
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.,f
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.,f
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.,f
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking_ but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.,f
An attempted slit.,f
What's this?,f
Just a little.,f
Mandella_ eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.,f
Block E?,f
He always look so,f
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.,f
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.,f
Patrick Verona   Random skid.,f
Who's that?,f
Don ' t you even dare. . .,m
Oh_ Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?,f
Because I like to torture you.,m
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?,f
Yeah_ but then I fucked up. I fell for her.,m
Is that right?,f
Besides_ I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.,m
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.,m
A Fender Strat. You bought this?,f
I didn't care about the money.,m
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now_ then a bonus for sleeping with me?,f
It wasn't like that.,m
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!,f
Wait I...,m
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?,m
That ' s completely adorable!,f
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail_ I don't know Marilyn Manson_ and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.,m
What?,f
My grandmother's .,m
Look_ I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.,f
Oh huh,m
It's just something I had.  You know,f
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?,m
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?,f
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.,m
Answer the question_ Patrick,f
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?,m
You tell me.,f
So I have to have a motive to be with you?,m
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?,f
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.,f
Why not?,m
No_ I won't go with you,f
No what?,m
No.,f
You know what I mean,m
Is that a request or a command?,f
Go to the prom with me,m
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?,f
No one else knows,m
What?,f
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.,m
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.,f
I hate peas.,m
Tell me something true.,f
I know the porn career's a lie.,f
Hearsay.,m
The duck?,f
Fallacy.,m
State trooper?,f
For. . . ?,f
You up for it?,m
You never disappointed me.,m
How?,f
Then you screwed up,m
Something like that,f
So if you disappoint them from the start_ you're covered?,m
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.,f
Yes,m
Acting the way we do.,f
So what's your excuse?,m
Yeah_ well_ don't let it get out,f
A soft side? Who knew?,m
I dazzled him with my wit,f
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?,m
Good call.,f
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.,m
The Partridge Family?,f
Maybe.,m
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?,f
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.,m
Put your right foot there --,f
Try lookin' at it from this angle,m
C'mon.  It's not that bad,f
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.,m
Look up_ sunshine,m
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.,f
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.,f
So what did I have an effect on ?,m
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.,f
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.,m
Unwelcome.,f
Wholesome.,m
Pleasant?,m
You 're so --,f
I heard there was a poetry reading.,m
What are you doing here?,f
Excuse me_ have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.,m
No offense_ but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all_ but ...,m
BIANCA,f
Who?,m
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.,f
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?,m
I'm gettin' there,m
Oh_ so now you think you know me?,f
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.,m
My father wouldn't approve of that that,f
Start a band?,m
This.,f
Do what?,m
I should do this.,f
Why'd you lie?,f
Then why'd you ask?,m
No_ you weren't,f
Maybe.,m
Were you in jail?,f
Busy,m
When you were gone last year -- where were you?,f
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.,f
And I'm in control of it.,m
What?,f
Kat! Wake up!,m
You know what they say,f
I thought you were above all that,m
"Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be ""cool""?  You don't think I can be ""laid back"" like everyone else?",f
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.,m
I hate him.,f
Dorsey.,m
Who?,f
Why'd you let him get to you?,m
Just let me sit down.,f
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?,m
Like you could find one,f
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.,m
Why?,f
Sure_ I do,m
You don't care if I die,f
I told you,m
Why 're you doing this?,f
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.,m
This is so patronizing.,f
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...,m
I know_ just let me sleep,f
Uh_ uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep,m
I just need to lie down for awhile,f
You're not okay.,m
I'm fine. I'm,f
Okay?,m
Funny_ you're the only one,f
I say_ do what you wanna do.,m
I'm getting trashed_ man. Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?,f
What's this?,m
Why_ don't you?,m
You know who The Raincoats are?,f
You know_ these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats_ but they're right up there.,m
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.,m
That's what you want_ isn't it?,f
Excuse me?,m

hey.  Great show_ huh?,m
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.,f
You're not a big talker_ are you?,m
Hi,f
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.,m
Are you following me?,f
Seven-thirty?,m
You -- covered in my vomit.,f
Come on -- the ponies_ the flat beer_ you with money in your eyes_ me with my hand on your ass...,m
And why would I do that?,f
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.,m
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.,f
You hate me don't you?,m
I know a lot more than that,m
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name_ screwboy?,f
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.,m
Oh_ right.  Friday.,f
Pick you up Friday_ then,m
My mission in life.,f
There's a way to get a guy's attention.,m
Sweating like a pig_ actually.  And yourself?,f
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?,m
Oh_ Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.,m
When I go?,f
You know_ fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence_ I won't even be able to watch the game.,m
No -- impressed.,m
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?,f
Bianca did what?,m
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.,f
Which parts?,m
Parts of it.,f
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?,m
No_ Daddy.,f
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?,m
Funny.,m
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.,f
Was that your sister?,m
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --,f
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.,m
So what I want doesn't matter?,f
As a parent_ that's my right,m
Because you're making decisions for me.,f
Why can't we agree on this?,m
I thought you were punishing me.,f
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?,m
Then tell them I had a seizure.,f
My insurance does not cover PMS,m
Enough!,m
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?,f
You decided.,f
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.,m
I know.,f
Just smack her now.,?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like_ right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?,f
"No ... I believe ""heinous bitch"" is the term used most often.",?
Tempestuous?,f
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...,?
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.,f
Well_ yes_ compared to your other choices of expression this year_ today's events are quite mild.  By the way_ Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well_ in case you're interested.,?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.,f
Katarina Stratford.  My_ my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.,?
Yeah...,f
Kat a fan_ too?,m
Right.,f
Macbeth_ right?,m
Oh yeah.,m
You think?,f
Yeah.  I guess.,f
Cool pictures.  You a fan?,m
Hi.,f
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?,m
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.,m
Sweet love_ renew thy force!,m
You were right. She's still pissed.,m
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.,m
So you got cozy with she who stings?,m
I'm likin' you guys better,m
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.,m
Yeah.,m
Ever been to Club Skunk?,m
Just for now.,m
"Are you telling me I'm a -  ""non-smoker""?",m
Good enough.,m
What?!,m
We're your guys.,m
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?,m
Patrick_ Pat_ you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.,m
So Dorsey can get the girl?,m
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.,m
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.,m
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.,m
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?,m
The situation is_ my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.,m
What plan?,m
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.,m
What?,m
Say it,m
See you next week!,m
You're completely demented.,?
Well_ you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...,m
You weren't abused_ you aren't stupid_ and as far as I can tell_ you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?,?
What's to discuss?,m
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?,?
I'm at a loss_ then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?,?
Touch of the flu.,m
I don't understand_ Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?,?
With the teeth of your zipper?,?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.,m
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.,?
I missed you.,m
That ' s what I thought,m
Absolutely not.,?
Did I have anything to say about it?,m
Your daughters went to the prom.,?
What just happened?,m
But -- who -- what --?,m
Have a great time_ honey!,?
Dr. Ruth?,?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap_ crap_ crap or crap,m
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.,m
They'll dance_ they'll kiss_ they'll come home.  Let her go.,?
Pirate -- no question.,m
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?,?
You're not helping.,m
Tumescent!,?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?,m
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.,m
What's a synonym for throbbing?,?
Make anyone cry today?,m
In the microwave.,?
Can't be that far_ I say.  Also_ I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...,?
We left three weeks ago_ Alonso. Can't be that near.,?
We should have seen land.,?
We'll all go crazy...,?
He's the devil's child...,?
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?,?
Ah_ leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.,?
What are you listening to_ chicken ass?,?
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!,?
The water's going putrid in the barrels.,?
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!,?
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!,?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.,m
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!,m
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?,?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?,m
If God intended our proximity to Asia_ do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?,?
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I_ too_ will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.,m
Is that all that interests you? Gold?,?
Trade_ Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo_ the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.,m
If they agree to follow me_ yes.,m
Your life_ and that of others!,?
Your Eminence_ there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.,m
Excellency_ you are right.,m
Senor Colon_ an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.,?
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations_ the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22_000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.,?
I am_ Your Eminence,m
Unfortunately_ Don Colon_ that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?,?
Yes_ your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.,m
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?,?
A waste...?  Let me tell you something_ Arojaz.  If your name_ or mine_ is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.,?
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...,?
You can see for yourself.,?
On the contrary_ Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.,?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now_ Don Sanchez.,?
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them_ when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.,?
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?,?
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.,?
The Judgment is ours!,?
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition_ Your Eminence...,?
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.,m
What is it_ now?  Tell me...,?
I am busy inside.,?
Can't you stay with us a little?,m
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich_ they only make him busier...,m
They took everything...,?
They tried... but I didn't let them.,?
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...,m
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.,m
You don't usually ask.,?
Beatrix_ I want to ask you something.,m
That's something you can't decide.,?
I don't want you to wait for me.,m
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.,?
Thank God...,?
She said yes.,m
I find that hard to believe.,?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...,m
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!,?
Are we going to argue?,m
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...,?
I haven't given you much of a life.,m
I know.,?
I could be gone for years.,m
I am afraid this is not the worst news.,?
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.,m
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.,?
How far from here?,m
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.,m
Viceroy of the West Indies.,?
Appointment to what?,m
My letters of appointment.,?
Yes... I remember...,m
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.,?
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.,m
May I ask by whom?,?
Forgive me_ Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.,m
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?,?
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.,?
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...,m
I want you to tell me everything you remember_ Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.,?
He never had one... except aboard my ships!,m
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.,?
What does he say?,m
I am not listening_ Father.  But I can't help hearing.,?
What are you listening to?,m
There must be a passage to that other ocean.,m
Father...,?
Not bad.,?
How are you feeling_ Fernando?,m
This time with me!,?
I have to explore the mainland.,m
Yes... Yes_ I do... On all of them!,m
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?,?
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?,?
There'll be a time.,m
I want to go with you!,?
All of them created by people like me.,m
Roofs... towers_ palaces... spires...,?
What do you see?,m
Look out of that window.,m
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.,?
Call them.,m
All I have to do is call the guards.,?
To rise so high_ in so short a time_ is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.,?
What...?  Do I have so many already?,m
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.,?
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!,m
Don Bobadilla is already a judge_ my Dear Don Cristobal.,?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.,m
... for a commoner?,m
You defend yourself admirably...,?
Forgive me_ Don Colon.  But what about gold?,?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature_ in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees_ filled with blossoms and fruits. And...,m
If you won't accept our proposal_ we'll simply find someone who will.,?
And were you never ambitious_ Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles_ a fault for the rest of us?,m
Then you are too ambitious.,?
I'm not bargaining!,m
I remind you_ Senor Colon_ that you are in no position to bargain with me.,?
NO...!  I have waited too long_ fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!,m
No?,?
No...,m
You never learned how to speak my language.,?
Utapan_ won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.,m
You did the same to your God!,?
You have to find them_ Utapan.  Look what they did!,m
Ask him if he will help.,m
He understands.,?
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?,m
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.,m
Chief says...,?
... and also to bring medicine.,m
Chief says -- he has a God.,?
To bring the word of God.,m
Why?,?
Thousands.,m
Chief says -- how many?,?
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.,m
Chief knows.,?
Tell the Chief we thank him.,m
You come!  You speak first!,?
Island.  Far.,?
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?,m
Say not here!  Cuba!,?
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!,m
Oh?  So you are a new man?,m
New worlds create new people.,m
I knew you would.,m
I have to disagree.,m
You'll always be older than me_ Father.,m
I suppose we're both old men now.,m
Give me absolution.,m
I believed in you...,m
You are bound by an oath_ Father.,m
My son_ my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher_ you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.,m
If I tell them_ they won't follow me.  You know that I am right_ Father.  You trust me...,m
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!,m
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.,m
How long?,m
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.,m
What are you saying?,m
Father_ I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.,m
I am listening_ my son.,m
Forgive me_ Father.  For I have sinned.,m
In Nomine Patris et Filius_ et Spiritus Sancti.,m
Colon!  Don't!,m
All of them!  Just lies!,m
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!,m
Colon!,m
Damn God!,m
If God intends you to go_ then you will go.,m
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?,m
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.,m
Only God knows the meaning of such words_ my son.,m
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!,m
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!,m
Passion is something one cannot control!,m
Father Marchena!,m
I'll try to remember that_ Marchena...,m
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you_ Colon.,m
So was Christ!,m
Esdras is a Jew.,m
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr_ Esdras...,m
How can you be so certain?,m
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.,m
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.,m
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...,m
Why do you wish to sail west?,m
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.,m
How did you manage it?,m
That's what it says.,m
God... That's in a week!,m
Father_ I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.,m
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together_ Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...,m
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.,m
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back_ after all this?,?
Thank you.,m
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.,?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...,m
Do they have such thoughts?,?
Thirty seven_ Your Majesty... And you?,m
How old are you_ Senor Colon?,?
A woman?,?
"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""...",m
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!,?
May I speak freely?,m
Surely you can do anything you want.,m
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.,?
That she was impregnable.,?
What did they say about Granada before today?,m
The ocean is uncrossable?,?
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.,m
I should not even be listening to you_ since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez_ that you are not a fool.,?
You will regret this.,?
You'll be held in detention_ deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?,m
Savagery is what monkeys understand.,?
In one act of brutality_ you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!,m
You did not hear me_ Don Colon.  Not my horse.,?
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.,m
My horse doesn't work.,?
We can't raise the wheel without it.,m
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest_ there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died_ we will accomplish what we came for.,m
We don't need to know.,?
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?,m
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders_ you'll do as I say.,m
We lost cousins_ friends.  We will wash this in blood.,?
The Indians have no such word_ Don Moxica.,m
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.,?
We can't be.,?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.,m
What's he doing?,?
Twenty eight.,?
What do you read?,m
Come over here.,m
Well_ I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.,?
And what do you think Mendez?,m
Well... It's the men_ Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...,?
God be with us admiral.,?
Due west_ Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...,m
You're right.  Let the men decide.,m
You tell that to them!,?
Pinzon_ Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!,m
You bloody...,?
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us_ remember?,m
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!,?
And then what?  Half of the water has gone_ the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!,m
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon_ these are my ships_ right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!,?
The land is there.  I know it!,m
We're lost!,?
You think I don't know that?,m
We're on the verge of a mutiny_ Colon!,?
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!,m
You must be mad...!,?
Six days ago_ yes.,m
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!,?
Immediately.,?
Where can I meet this man?,m
Because he is not afraid of me.,?
Then why?,?
I know_ I should not tolerate his impertinence.,?
And who would you think of_ for such a task?,?
He must be replaced.,?
Then_ what do you suggest_ Don Sanchez?,?
Is this true_ Brother Buyl?,?
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...,?
We weren't expecting immediate profits_ were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.,?
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive_ Your Majesty.,?
Yes.  It would be a pity_ wouldn't it?  Call him back!,?
... Into a monk...,?
Never_ Your Majesty.  Although...,?
You were right_ Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.,?
Yes_ Your Majesty.,?
Is that the man I knew_ Treasurer Sanchez?,?
Officers_ there's your killer_ do your duty_ arrest him!,m
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught_ we are sent to mental hospital...,m
I don't think it's abuse_ I think it's torture.,m
I'm abused.  Don't you think?,m
Can I see your back?,m
Out on my back when I was a small boy.,m
Your father put cigarettes out on you?,m
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.,m
Yeah_ he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?,m
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?,m
Yeah_ yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...,m
Back in the Czech Republic?,m
Yeah_ she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.,m
Your mother was blind?,m
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.,m
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.,m
Give me another one_ please.,m
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.,m
What else do you need?,m
This is not about money_ Emil.  I need your trust in me.,m
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.,m
But it's...,m
No.  No way.,m
I would say...half.  Half is fair.,m
What's your cut?  How much?,m
Look_ I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.,m
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?,m
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.,m
No_ he is here.  Shit...,m
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.,m
What about Oleg?,m
Well_ you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.,m
I was all of these.,m
...delusions and paranoia.,m
Oh_ sure.,m
You bring the cigarettes?,m
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes_ another sent a check. Another wants a check.,m
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.,m
Yes.  Yes_ come with me!,m
I'm coming with you.,m
Where are we going?,m
Don't say anything.,m
He has the camera!  He took the movie!,m
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?,m
Oh no!  No!  Shit!,m
Here.  I have your money.,m
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.,m
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.,m
Daphne_ I...,m
I don't want to drag you down with me.,f
...Do you really want me to forget about you?,m
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.,f
Pouring it out!,f
What are you doing?,m
I'll get my clothes.,f
I'll make some for us.,m
In the kitchen.,f
Do you have coffee?,m
Right.,f
You better get packed.,m
I'm glad I met you.,m
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.,f
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.,m
If you were my boyfriend_ I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.,f
If I was your boyfriend_ I might be.,m
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?,f
Is he your boyfriend?,m
I'm sorry.,f
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.,m
Are you alright?,f
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...,f
They're not gonna send you right back.,m
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?,f
I know.,m
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.,f
I'm just trying to find out who you are.,m
What are you asking me?,f
So you were never a prostitute?,m
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it_ but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.,f
No.,f
What about back home?,m
No.,f
Did you ever turn tricks before?,m
Yes_ I considered it.,f
You considered becoming a prostitute?,m
Yeah.  This way.,m
So...the station is empty?,f
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.,m
Somewhere else?,f
I can't take you to my place.,m
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?,f
Divorced.,m
Are you married?,f
They won't until this is over.,m
I will if they don't send me back.,f
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.,m
Now I become custody of police department?,f
Yes_ but he was a cop.,f
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.,m
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.,f
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.,f
Look_ we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?,m
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right_ a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.,f
A cop?,m
No_ no_ don't talk to Immigration!,f
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.,m
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?,m
If I tell you_ will you arrest me?,f
Whether you tell us or not_ we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.,m
Go on.,m
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken_ she let me use theirs.,f
C'mon_ start at the beginning.  You know these people?,m
I told your partner_ I can't help.  I didn't see anything.,f
Yeah_ sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.,?
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.,m
Oh yeah...?  Alright.,?
Look_ after Jordy briefs me_ you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.,m
Well_ I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.,?
It was my decision_ not his.,m
Oh.,?
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.,?
But Chief?  Over this??,m
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page_ as a hero_ this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.,?
End my career?,m
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.,?
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.,m
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!,?
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.,m
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!,?
Okay.  But not water sports.,?
Chief - mind if I take her?,m
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!,?
No!  Nothing happened.,m
A shower!?  Did you take one_ too?,?
I let her take a shower.,m
What do you mean_ 'cleaned up?',?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.,m
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!,?
Hey_ Chief_ what are you doing here?,m
'Cause we got more important things to do_ like finding out who did it.,m
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?,?
Who do you think_ Chief?!,m
Who did cause and origin?,?
Yeah.,m
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?,?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.,m
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?,?
You do that_ wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.,?
I said_ yeah_ you're right_ Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.,m
What was that_ Korfin?,?
Yeah_ right.,m
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.,?
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry_ we'll get those fuckers.,m
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!,?
No.  I'm okay.,?
Are you hit?,m
Stay with her.,?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.,m
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.,m
Yeah.,?
Only one guys checked in?,m
It's okay.,m
Sorry...PD only.,?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.,?
Any I.D.?,m
Takin' a bath.,?
Where is she?,m
A timer.,m
What's he looking for?,?
You ready?,?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.,m
When?,?
I'm gonna propose.,m
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.,m
It was freaky_ I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.,?
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?,?
Vodka tonic.,m
Coffee for me_ I gotta slow down.,?
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.,?
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!,m
Tall_ short-haired_ scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter_ with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.,?
Describe him.,m
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.,?
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her_ too.,?
What are you saying?,m
Boy_ she's so popular all the sudden.,?
Did you tell him you did?,m
No.,?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?,m
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia_ but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there_ you know_ it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...,?
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?,?
We don't have her I.D. yet_ but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.,m
What's wrong?,?
Homicide_ Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.,m
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...,?
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.,m
Who's there?,?
You know_ I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time_ but I still kept him.,m
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?,m
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here_ here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career_ your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there_ they know your face.  And the little fame_ the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.,m
But_ I mean_ didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean_ you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.,m
Well_ it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand_ that's why you're a professional.,m
I told you_ you know_ I thought I was doing the right thing_ you know_ I think she's innocent.,m
No_ I don't think you were a fool_ I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean_ to say the least_ you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her_ it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want_ but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.,m
Yeah_ just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look_ I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up_ but...,m
Just a shower?,m
I took her there for a shower and that's it.,m
Well_ you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.,m
Look_ Eddie_ I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.,m
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.,m
Hey.  I'm a professional.,m
Okay_ tell you what_ I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.,m
You know what I'm saying here.,m
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?,m
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.,m
So am I.,m
I'm serious here.,m
My point exactly.,m
I don't have a girlfriend.,m
What would your girlfriend think of that?,m
Yeah.,m
You wanna talk to her alone?,m
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get_ they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.,m
Raw deal.,m
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.,m
Something back home?,m
Why not?,m
Is that all there is?,m
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.,m
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid,m
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way_ aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.,m
I wanted to run up to a building on fire_ kick in the door_ rush into the smoke and save a kid.,m
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door_ kicking it in_ pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?,m
Of course.,m
So am I.  Alright_ I'll go inside and you cover the back.,m
I'm on duty.,m
You thirsty?,m
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.,m
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.,m
Better than one.,m
Two heads.,m
I'll call it... tails.,m
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win_ you don't come.,m
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.,m
I'll let you know what happens.,m
But what if it does?  You might need my help.,m
This has nothing to do with your fire.,m
Mind if I ride along with you?,m
You got any better ideas?,m
You goin' to the escort service?,m
Stay here.,m
My folks are.,m
You're Polish?,m
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.,m
This isn't homicide school.,m
I can watch you_ Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.,m
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.,m
I'll come with you.,m
Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.,m
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?,m
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up_ no proper funeral_ it's like condemning them to hell.,m
Look_ I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?,m
What would you call her?,m
Who says she's a suspect?,m
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.,m
Hmmmm.,m
Pretty.,m
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.,m
You were right_ they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.,m
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off_ too.  What about the report?,m
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?,m
Did you get a report from the M.E.?,m
Good.  Good.  Commendable.,m
I don't even watch TV.,m
Nah_ why should you?,m
Well_ just so you know_ I don't care about that stuff.,m
Well_ just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.,m
Nah_ I musta missed it.,m
Watch the news?,m
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.,m
Why don't you explain it_ Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?,m
No_ what is it?,m
You know what that is_ right?,m
No_ we don't mind.  You mind Leon?,m
Hey_ that's great you guys got it all wrapped up_ but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.,m
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me_ they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming_ would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?,m
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?,m
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.,m
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.,m
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.,m
Then do it_ asshole.,m
I kill someone famous.,m
What's your accomplishment.,m
Your opinion.  You see_ they going to make a movie about me_ too_ Eddie.  And write books.,m
What do you want?,m
So...who's Nicky?,m
Don't be late.,m
Thank you.,f
See you later.  Good luck.,m
Okay.,f
Yeah_ yeah.  Good thing.,m
Okay.  And you know what_ I'll swing by my place_ grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.,f
Yeah.  I promise.,m
You promise?,f
Tonight.,m
Okay_ til tonight.,f
I love you.,f
Patronizing you... Nay_ I love you.,m
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.,f
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead_ just imagine that_ uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.,m
Promise?,f
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.,m
No.  No_ listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know_ the shoe thing and the marriages and...,f
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.,m
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now_ we're in the middle of something here.,f
Well_ that's great.,m
Yeah.,f
That's good.,m
Oh my G-d_ they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!,f
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?,f
Answer it.,m
No.  Tell me what you want to say.,f
Answer the phone.,m
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.,f
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?,f
Could be Leon's.,m
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?,f
You're not so bad yourself.,f
You're ruthless.,m
Well_ who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?,f
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.,m
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.,f
Yeah_ well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...,m
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.,f
I'm not.,m
Alright_ alright_ Eddie.  Don't patronize me.,f
Maybe I should just_ ya know...turn to the cameras and say_ do you mind if we just work something out?,m
Stop it.,f
Oh_ I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you_ sweetheart?  Oh...,m
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.,f
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!,m
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.,f
Hey.,m
Hey_ honey.,f
Okay.,f
Alright.,m
Alright.,f
Alright?,m
Alright.,f
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.,m
Eddie_ are you okay?,f
Alright_ cut_ cut_ cut.,f
Um...now is not a good time_ okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot_ Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.,m
Do you have the suspect in custody?,f
He was hurt_ but not seriously.  He'll be fine.,m
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner_ Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?,f
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.,m
I understand_ but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?,f
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.,m
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?,f
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.,m
Is it drug related?,f
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.,m
Can we go up to the crime scene?,f
There are two bodies found at this point.,m
How many victims are up there?,f
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.,m
Detective_ does it look like a murder?,f
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.,m
Any chance we can do that again?,?
Yeah_ yeah.  Jesus.,m
Okay.  You ready?,?
Keep them out of my way.,m
Ready?,?
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.,?
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.,m
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.,m
That's unique.,?
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.,m
Not what.  Who.,m
So what's unique?,?
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life_ they make you a better person_ they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids_ I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right_ Leon?,?
How old are your kids?,m
I'm not moody.,m
I think you're getting a little moody there_ Eddie.,?
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean_ what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.,m
Sooner or later that's everybody.,?
Jesus Christ.,?
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say_ lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky_ takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.,m
No.  Are you proposing?,m
Are you married?,?
Dog food.,m
And what do you do with the bones?,?
You stuff sausage in it.,m
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?,?
I am butcher.,m
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?,?
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.,m
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.,?
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.,m
What?  It doesn't work that way.,?
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.,m
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.,?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.,m
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.,?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.,m
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.,m
Let her go!  Let her go!!,m
Tell him to put his gun down!,m
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.,m
Where's your partner?,m
Get down on your knees.,m
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh_ look_ you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.,m
You'll be my first.,m
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.,m
Tommy_ take a walk.,m
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.,m
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?,m
Alright_ alright - don't hurt me! Please_ it's in my book_ in my purse!,?
Give me the address!!,m
Look_ man_ I don't give a shit if you want sex or not_ but you're payin' for my time.,?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.,m
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you_ you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?,?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?,m
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?,?
Where is escort service?,m
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?,?
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne_ you know her?,m
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.,?
Baby_ I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl_ I'm mommy_ I'm a Czech girl.,?
Where's Czech girl?,m
Hi_ I'm Honey.,?
He doesn't speak English.,m
I'd like to speak for himself_ okay?,?
Two weeks.,m
How long are you planning to stay?,?
We are both from Prague.,m
No_ you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi_ how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?,?
Is there a problem?,m
Please join us.  Come on forward.,?
Yes.,m
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?,?
Can you show me?  Sir_ no cameras in the FIS area!,?
I have five-hundred dollars.,m
How much money are you carrying with you?,?
Two weeks holiday.,m
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?,?
Yes sir.,m
Next.  Could I see your documents_ please?,?
Yes.  Both.,m
Hey_ tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look_ you want magazine or not?,?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?,m
In here_ says he wants a million.,?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?,m
This all you want?,?
New York's finest.  This is his case.,?
Who is he?,m
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!,m
Traitor!!,m
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little_ small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.,m
No_ I don't get that!,m
You got that?,m
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.,m
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.,m
Credit?,m
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.,m
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.,m
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize_ if it wasn't for my film_ for my talent_ my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.,m
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?,m
Be quiet.  Watch.,m
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!,m
Bad last moment - I cut it out.,m
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!',m
Shut up.  Look!,m
I'm serious.,m
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.,m
In movie they make of us_ who do you think would act me?,m
Oleg_ don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars_ didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!,m
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?,m
Cut!,m
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!,m
Good idea!,m
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught_ we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law_ we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free_ rich and famous!,m
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.,m
Sit down!,m
Let me get a shot of it.,m
What does it look like?  It's an address book!,m
What is that?,m
Put the camera down_ Oleg.,m
Why not?,m
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either_ did you?  Don't lie_ I won't be angry.,m
I did.,m
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.,m
What is it?,m
Don't want to film this?,m
Oh_ shit.  I hate looking at that!,m
Does it hurt?,m
Shut up.,m
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.,m
Oleg_ get in bathroom_ stay there and shut up!,m
Whatever we do - we fuck her_ right?,m
Get in the bathroom!,m
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?,m
Whore?,m
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!,m
How you erase this?,m
You said speak Czech!,m
Speak English!,m
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.,m
Turn that fucking thing off!,m
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.,m
What?,m
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse_ Oleg.,m
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.,m
Turn that off!  Get the bags.,m
We have no money.  Come on.,m
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.,m
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!,m
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?,m
Don't speak Russian!,m
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!,m
I want to document my trip to America.,m
Did you hear what I said?,m
Okay.,m
Don't fool around.,m
Okay.,m
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.,m
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?,m
We started over_ you can too.,?
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!,m
It's easy to learn.,?
As a plumber?!,m
Yes_ the money is good.,?
A job?,m
I can get you a job.,?
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!,?
Ha. Ha.,m
We spent it!,?
Milos.  Get my money!,m
Take your eyes off her_ Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!,?
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?,m
Did you hurt her?,?
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.,m
Surprise!  Surprise!,m
Emil???!,?
You want the tape?  There it is!,?
Viewer discretion advised!,?
Trust me_ you'll want to take this call.,?
I can't talk to anybody right now_ can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.,?
You've got a call.,?
What are you doing here?,?
Robert...?,?
Don't give me that fucking shit.,?
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!,?
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.,?
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries_ they'll convict him.,?
And you_ you'll pay for what you did!,?
Paulie_ you've got kids_ right?,?
Yeah?,?
In love?  With who?,?
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.,?
Isn't he a little moody?,?
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!,f
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.,?
Alright.  Go ahead.,f
I'm trying to tell you.,?
I want to hear everything he said.,f
Well_ he...,?
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?,f
I know.,?
Excuse me?,?
"Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy_ I see movie at school called ""It's a Wonderful Life"" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.",m
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?,?
I'm here for movies.,m
What are you coming here to do?,?
A cheap hotel.,m
Yes_ we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?,?
New York.,m
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?,?
I speak English.,m
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?,?
Yes...he's my friend.,m
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct_ you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.,m
Well_ he killed my partner!,?
He's my collar!,m
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!,?
No way!  He's mine!,m
I'll take him.,?
Evidence.  Of a homicide.,m
What was that?,?
Yeah_ well_ some people got their priorities straight.,?
And while they're burning up_ they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.,m
That's what it looks like to me.,?
So the way you see it_ two crack heads burned themselves up?,m
Thanks.  Appreciate it.,m
No.  Go ahead.,?
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.,m
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!,?
You okay?,m
Hey.  C'mon_ you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!,?
I'll send a cop back for you.,m
Oh yeah?  Guess again.,m
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.,?
Okay_ you're under arrest!  Now you happy?,m
Alright_ how 'bout all your fuckin' money?,?
Look_ I don't have time for you_ get out of my way!!,m
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?,?
Hey_ by the way_ I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.,?
Yeah?  What kind?,m
I used an accelerant.,?
How did you start the fire this time?,m
Yeah_ I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now_ are you guys gonna arrest me_ or not?,?
What's that on your forehead_ Max? That's a nice attention getter.,m
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!,m
What the hell happened?,m
Get outta here!,m
Not good.,m
How was it?,m
Lay down.  Stay down_ Bobby.,m
It hurts.  Aw_ Jesus!,m
Bobby_ Bobby!  Where're you hit?!,m
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.,m
Aren't you tired?,m
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.,m
You hear that question_ Garcia?,m
How long they been livin' here?,m
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright_ I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.,m
Maybe you can be his stand-in.,m
Yeah?,m
Now that you know him_ maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.,m
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!,m
What?,m
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.,m
What??,m
He knew all along.,m
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.,m
But you knew that_ right?,m
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.,m
Don't blow your nose!,m
Clean?,m
Mouth's clean_ too.,m
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.,m
Nah_ not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.,m
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!,m
Oh yeah_ why?,m
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.,m
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?,m
I don't know_ you think Eddie will give me his autograph?,m
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?,m
Where you been_ man?  We got a celebrity!,m
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU_ TOO!!!,m
Look_ you can't shoot him in cold blood.,?
Take the car.  Get outta here_ Tommy.,m
Don't stoop to his level!,?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.,m
What are you gonna do?,?
The clerk?,?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?,m
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.,?
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.,?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?,?
We're in negotiations_ that's correct.,?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?,?
Look_ I'm in here.  You call this a career move?,?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it_ jump started your career as an artist?,?
Look_ I'm a victim here_ too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art_ now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.,?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.,?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger_ but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.,?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?,?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.,?
Your doctor?,?
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who_ as you know_ made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.,?
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.,?
CONTINUED,?
I'm sorry_ Dr. Smyslov_ but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.,?
CONTINUED,?
How did they manage to do that without any communication?,?
CONTINUED,?
Well_ I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.,?
CONTINUED,?
She's wonderful.,?
CONTINUED,?
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes_ but I'd love to.,?
CONTINUED,?
Well_ how nice to see you again_ Elena. You're looking wonderful.,?
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE,?
Roger.,m
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.,m
I guess not.,m
I guess you don't know your own strength_ old boy.,m
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.,m
Well_ now that we've got one that's actually failed_ we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.,m
It's the last one.,m
Yes.,m
Hal?,m
Well_ I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.,m
Two more.,m
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?,m
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.,m
No.,m
You're kidding.,m
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.,m
Oh_ I'm fine_ I'm wide awake. What's up?,m
Are you reasonably awake?,m
Good morning. How's it going?,m
Anyway_ it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.,m
Yes_ but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.,m
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.,m
Yes_ I don't know what to make of it.,m
Well_ that's something.,m
Still_ all we have to do is ask Hal.,m
I guess it isn't.,m
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.,m
But not completely inconceivable?,m
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.,m
Yes_ but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.,m
Not really. Though_ it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.,m
That's true.,m
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us_ but they'd never keep anything from Hal.,m
How?,m
Of course_ it would be very easy for us to find out now.,m
Yes_ I thought so.,m
That seems very unlikely.,m
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.,m
Oh_ well_ apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know_ and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.,m
No_ as a matter of fact_ I didn't.,m
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.,m
Oh?,m
I suppose so. Though_ of course_ there's a more sinister explanation.,m
I suppose the idea was specialized training.,m
No. I never did_ either.,m
I must say_ I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.,m
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.,m
Well_ what do you think we ought to do about it?,m
It's possible.,m
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall_ and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.,m
Yesterday_ I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control_ and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine_ and apparently not yours either.,m
Yes.,m
Really.,m
Interesting that you mention it_ because I've got the same problem.,m
That's right. Well_ naturally_ I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.,m
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.,m
Yes?,m
It's about my salary cheques.,m
What's up?,m
Well_ it's nothing really important_ but it's annoying.,m
Sure_ what is it?,m
Dave_ if you've a minute_ I'd like your advice on something.,m
Okay_ come on down.,m
Okay. ,m
Right. Just a sec.,m
Hi. Frank... coming in_ please.,m
Listen to me very carefully_ Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on_ I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.,m
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now_ Dave_ but it would be a crying shame_ since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are_ and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.,m
I am prepared to do that anyway.,m
Hal_ unless you follow my instructions_ I shall be forced to disconnect you.,m
I'm sorry_ Dave_ but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4_ quote_ When the crew are dead or incapacitated_ the computer must assume control_ unquote. I must_ therefore_ override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.,m
Hal_ I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.,m
I can tell from the tone of your voice_ Dave_ that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.,m
I don't like to assert myself_ Dave_ but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.,m
Hal_ switch to manual hibernation control.,m
Look_ Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.,m
I'm goin to do this myself_ Hal. Let me have the control_ please.,m
If you're determined to revive the crew now_ I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.,m
I don't really agree with you_ Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.,m
It doesn't have to be_ Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control_ please.,m
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.,m
The antenna has to be replaced.,m
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress_ but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.,m
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?,m
Yes_ it is.,m
Too bad about Frank_ isn't it?,m
Well_ that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.,m
Yes_ it is_ Hal.,m
Is your confidence in me fully restored?,m
And don't you worry about it.,m
Well_ don't worry about it.,m
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding_ Hal.,m
Naturally_ Dave_ I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed_ but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected_ even temporarily_ as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.,m
Okay_ Hal_ well let's see the way things go from here on.,m
Look_ Dave_ I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job_ and that you're trying to be helpful_ but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units_ and with your test gear.,m
Hal_ is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?,m
I'm not questioning your word_ Dave_ but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.,m
Yes_ I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.,m
You probably also know that we found them okay.,m
Yes_ I know.,m
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?,m
Sure_ Dave_ what's up?,m
Not now_ Hal_ I'd like to talk to you about something.,m
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please_ let me have the hard copy.,m
The unit is still operational_ Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.,m
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.,m
What is it_ Hal?,m
Sorry to interrupt the festivities_ Dave_ but I think we've got a problem.,m
He's got a point.,m
I'm sorry_ Frank_ but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.,m
Well_ the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going_ what will we do when we get there_ when are we coming back_ and... why are we going?,m
CONTINUED,?
Still_ you really don't believe it_ do you?,m
CONTINUED,?
Well... it's silly_ but... if you want to_ why don't you?,m
CONINUED,?
Well_ what is it?,m
CONTINUED,?
Did they have any explanation for this?,m
CONTINUED,?
Yes_ I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.,m
CONTINUED,?
Goodbye_ Daddy.,?
'Bye_ 'bye_ now_ sweetheart.,?
Yes_ Daddy.,?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right_ Darling?,?
Thank you_ Daddy.,?
Okay_ sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.,?
Three_ darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.,?
How many days until you come home?,?
Okay_ sweetheart. Well_ I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.,?
She's in the bathroom.,?
Where is Mrs. Brown?,?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.,?
One_ two_ three. Can I speak to Mommy?,?
In three days_ darling_ I hope.,?
When are you coming home?,?
No_ I'm sorry_ darling_ I told you I won't be home for a few days.,?
Are you coming to my party?,?
Yes_ I know that sweetheart.,?
I'm having a party tomorrow.,?
I'm fine_ Daddy. When are you coming home?,?
I'm at Space Station Five_ darling. How are you?,?
I'll bet it's a fortune.,?
I was working out what this trip must cost_ taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.,?
Yes_ well_ whatever it is_ they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.,?
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.,?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.,?
Well_ I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.,?
Well_ how's it going back there?,?
Thank you.,?
Oh_ thank you very much.,?
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.,?
Well_ Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.,?
Well_ I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.,?
No_ thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.,?
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?,?
Well_ that does sound very odd.,?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.,?
Well_ where are all of you off to?,?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.,?
How is gregor?,?
Oh_ that's such a delightful age.,?
Oh_ she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact_ she's six tomorrow.,?
And your charming little daughter?,?
Yes_ it's coming along very well.,?
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.,?
Yes_ I think so. Just about then.,?
Fine.,?
Well_ shall we go through Documentation?,?
Yes_ very pleasant.,?
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?,?
Please_ it really doesn't matter.,?
Well_ thank you very much for being so understanding.,?
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time_ and I was on my way out of the office when_ suddenly_ the phone rang.,?
How do you do_ Mr. Miller?,?
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.,?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base_ Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.,?
Quite frankly_ we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something_ apperently_ of an unknown origin. Is this_ in fact_ what has happened?,?
Certainly.,?
Dr. Floyd_ at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss_ may I ask you a straightforward question?,?
Well_ I'm glad about that.,?
Fortunately_ they did.,?
Yes... Well_ I hope the crew got back safely.,?
Yes_ and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.,?
I see.,?
That's right.,?
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?,?
Yes_ well at first we thought that was the explanation_ but it's been going on for the past ten days.,?
Yes. Well_ for one thing_ whenever you phone the base_ all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.,?
Really?,?
Well_ it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.,?
I'm sorry_ but I'm not sure I know what you mean.,?
Yes_as a matter of fact_ I am.,?
Are you_ by any chance_ going up to your base at Clavius?,?
Well_ as it happens_ I'm on my way up to the moon,?
Yes_ really_ thank you very much.,?
Are you quite sure?,?
Oh_ I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.,?
I don't think it has_ but I'd like to check that. Simpson_ what's the log on that?,?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?,?
Well_ not really. At first glance_ black would suggest something sun-powered_ but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?,?
Any ideas about the colour?,?
Tomb_ shine_ survey-marker spare part_ take your choice.,?
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?,?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill,?
Any clue as to what it is?,?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.,?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?,?
Yes_ it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.,?
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.,?
Dr. Floyd_ how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?,?
Well_ thank you very much_ and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.,?
No_ of course_ Captain_ I can understand your concern.,?
Well_ fine. Thanks very much_ anyway_ and I hope you don't mind me asking?,?
Yes_ well_ I wouldn't have been too concerned about it_ except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and_ as a matter of fact_ I've heard that ten people have died already.,?
I see. Well_ I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.,?
Well_ I'll tell you why I ask. You see_ I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so_ and with all these stories one hears_ I'm a little concerned about her.,?
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?,?
I see.,?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.,?
What do you mean?,?
Incidentally_ Dr. Floyd_ I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?,?
Thank you.,?
Oh_ no_ thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.,?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?,?
When do we arrive at Clavius?,?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.,?
Oh_ marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.,?
All right_ Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy_ please.,m
Not really_ Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.,m
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?,m
Let me see the tracking alignment display.,m
I know you did_ Frank_ but I assure you there was an impending failure.,m
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.,m
Yes_ Hal_ what's up?,m
Opening pod bay doors.,m
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.,m
Hal_ check all airlock doors secure.,m
Roger.,m
Hal_ maintain normal E.V.A. condition.,m
I understand.,m
Hal_ I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.,m
Five by five_ Frank.,m
Roger.,m
Hal_ have pod arms secure the component.,m
Thank you very much_ Hal.,m
That's true.,m
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program_ and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?,m
That's true,m
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation_ the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?,m
That's true.,m
That's true.,m

Look_ give me a break_ you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.,?
I don't give a damn about his girl...,m
I don't give a shit who you ask.,?
Maybe I better ask around_ see what your pals think.,m
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.,?
Now how's your memory doin'?,m
No_ man_ I think I'll have a vodka.,m
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.,?
Vodka.,m
Yeah.,?
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No_ not a turban_ you know_ a squaw.,?
Hey_ what about me?,?
He's just kiddin'_ you just keep doin' what I tell ya_ you'll be okay.,?
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.,?
Just do what I say_ okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?,?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.,?
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.,?
I never paid for it in my life.,?
Yeah_ dummy.  Money.,?
Pay money?,?
Pros.,?
Whaddya mean_ buy?,?
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.,?
I ain't tired yet.,?
I want to drive awhile.,?
You got a real big mouth_ convict.,?
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck_ Tonto.,?
Now you're talkin'. See ya...,?
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin'_ okay?,m
Hey_ no_ I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it_ but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...,m
Hey_ don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro_ remember?,?
Here you go_ baby.,m
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact_ I think we can have a party.,m
Hello_ again.,?
Here's hoping_ baby...,m
Well_ maybe I'll see you later ...,?
No_ it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...,m
What's the matter with my place?,?
No_ baby_ nothin' like that. Look_ there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...,m
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?,?
Yeah_ i been waiting three years.,m
You're in a hurry.,?
Here you go sweetheart_ throw it my way.,m
Hey_ don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?,?
Goodbye.,m
No_ I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.,?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...,m
Hey_ what kind of talk is that?,?
Excuse me_ baby_ but if i don't get some action tonight_ I'm gonna bust.  You interested?,m
I'm candy...,?
In the back.  Down the other corridor.,?
Where's ganz?,m
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise_ he gets ventilated.,m
No chance.,?
You're gonna help us take him.,m
Yeah.  Sure_ i'm crazy in love with him_ who wouldn't be...,?
You and the other one_ you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...,m
No time for any of that crap any more_ lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.,m
Would you guys...,?
I hear you've got visitors.,m
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...,?
How about it?,m
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.,?
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.,m
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.,?
You're done.  End of story.,m
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.,?
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...,?
I don't think you're gonna make it.,m
After I get outta this_ cop...I'm gonna live forever...,?
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...,?
You lying son of a bitch...,m
No trouble_ Jack. But_ listen_ suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?,m
Thanks.,m
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.,m
No_ you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again_ I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.,m
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.,m
That's right. Not my style_ Reggie..,m
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?,m
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.,m
There's nothin' to talk about.,m
Wait a minute_ Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair_ man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.,m
Hey_ Jack_ real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.,m
Okay_ reggie_ start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.,m
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...,m
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.,m
You okay?,m
Well_ you got to admit we come a long way.,m
Partnership?,m
Yeah_ and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.,m
Sure_ I'll give you a shot at it_ but Ganz is mine.  You know_ that big Indian plays it for keeps...,m
If we run into Billy first_ let me try and talk him in.,m
Whatever play I maker just back me up.,m
Hey_ there she is...,m
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything_ I'm gonna know it.,m
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean_ they could be in Rio de Janeiro.,m
If she's right_ and if you don't screw up.,m
Do I get to kiss her too?,m
Yeah_ too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together_ hardly any clothes one watching TV...,m
Yeah_ well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...,m
Don't worry about it.,m
It's late_ they're closing...,m
Yeah_ but we didn't get 'em.,m
Naw_ you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.,m
Sorry we didn't do better_ Jack. I feel like I let you down.,m
I don't know about you_ but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.,m
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.,m
I had it impounded.  Come on_ we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.,m
Hey_ how'd my car get here?,m
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.,m
Notice something funny about that bus?,m
Luther's on the move...,m
Why?,m
When you been in prison three years_ it don't take long. Let's go.,m
That was quick.,m
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.,m
Yeah_ I see her.,m
Yeah. Guess not.,m
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything_ Jack ...,m
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look_ I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya_ doin' my job.,m
You sure that's the reason?,m
I don't know why_ but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it_ or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...,m
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...,m
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?,m
So you took the rest of the night off...,m
"They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the ""Don't Disturb"" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.",m
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.,m
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.,m
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.,m
We missed.,m
What about Ganz?,m
What about Luther?,m
Hello. And goodbye.,m
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.,m
Where's luther?,m
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass_ right?,m
Hey_ Jack_ how ya doin'? What took you so long to call_ man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah_ Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.,m
No way...,m
You stay with me...,m
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.,m
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping_ then you're all set.,m
That was in style a couple years back_ man.,m
Yeah_ most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?,m
We're getting too close ... Cates_ what's the matter_ you been takin' dumb pills?,m
Class isn't somethin' you buy_ punk. Look at you_ five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.,m
No class...,m
What you don't understand is_ I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.,m
You know_ I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.,m
Yeah_ it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...,m
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...,m
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is_ which would be amazin'_ cause I already think he's real dumb.,m
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...,m
You got a very depressing view of life_ man... you gotta smile once in awhile...,m
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...,m
Doesn't it get... Tiring?,m
If they don't tell me what I need to know...,m
Say_ do you always work people over like you did Luther?,m
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.,m
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns_ money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.,m
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...,m
Oh_ yeah_ does bein' in love make you stupid?,m
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.,m
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass_ I'd  just leave town.,m
Tryin' to save his girl_ man. He's in another world.,m
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.,m
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.,m
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.,m
Jesus Christ_ look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?,m
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.,m
Musta got some primo bondsman.,m
What?,m
Guess what?  Luther just got in line.,m
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.,m
You took a big chance_ leaving this here all this time.,m
Shit.,m
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once_ not twice_ Jack.,m
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.,m
You just drove by it.,m
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.,m
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.,m
You're a real case_ you know that_ Jack?,m
Where's the goddamn car?,m
Yeah.  Right.,m
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money_ you're gonna be sorry we ever met.,m
Right_ partner.,m
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress_ right?,m
Where's the money?,m
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.,m
You gonna let me keep any of it?,m
Not likely_ convict.,m
We split 50-50?,m
You catch on real fast...Okay_ Jack_ let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?,m
He's after your money.,m
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty_ livin' in the high cotton_ then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.,m
Just tell me about the money.,m
Jesus.,m
Half a million.,m
How much?,m
I been waiting a long time for some money.,m
One thing's for sure_ Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.,m
They saved your ass_ convict.,m
Naw_ you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.,m
Yeah_ right.  You want to try again?,m
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...,m
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.,m
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...,m
I'm impressed with you too_ Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.,m
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far_ what I got outta you is nothin'...,m
You wanna leave_ man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.,m
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So_ instead of me being where I oughta be_ which is in bed giving my girl the high_ hard one_ I'm out here doing this shit_ roaming around with some overdressed_ charcoal-colored loser like you.,m
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...,m
Let's go.,m
Come on.,m
Must be billy's girl.,m
There.,m
While you're at it_ You can give me the switchblade_ too.,m
You made that move_ huh?,m
Some of us citizens are with you all the way_ Officer.,m
That wasn't necessary_ buddy. I got this under control.,m
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.,m
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.,m
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.,m
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here_ I'll even loan you my badge.,m
The bet's off.,m
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.,m
You tell me what Ganz busted out for_ he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is_ you're part of it.,m
What are you talkin' about?,m
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.,m
That's never been one of my problems.,m
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.,m
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number_ or a dead Indian_ or anything else useful_ then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...,m
I got two problems.  Number one_ I'm not playin' games.  Number two_ you got nothin' to bet with.,m
Hey_ you wanna bet?,m
You need five years training to handle a joint like...,m
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...,m
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...,m
But you can handle it all right_ huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...,m
If they kick my ass_ they'll sure as hell carve yours up...,m
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?,m
This part of town_ they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...,m
It's a long shot_ but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.,m
Well?,m
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?,m
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.,m
You have a good time?,m
Last night.,m
Last night_ two nights ago_ three?,m
I don't give out the details.,m
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.,m
Now_ where we goin'_ convict?,m
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway_ what the fuck do you care?,m
You really do have onoe_ huh_ Jack... what's her problem besides you?,m
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.,m
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?,m
Yeah_ I want mandolins_ flowers... They move off down the corridor.,m
Yeah_ I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.,m
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it_ you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people_ nice music...,m
We eat when I say we eat.,m
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.,m
"Yeah_ well_ my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn ""trim"" hunt... stop moaning.",m
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.,m
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.,m
If you let him run around till Tuesday_ he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you_ motherfucker?,m
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.,m
I think you better put him on ice_ man.,m
What do you think?,m
Want to try it again?,m
Thank you.,m
Hey_ this works pretty good.,m
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.,m
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.,m
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.,m
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff_ Jack_ I need to talk to this man.,m
I'm helpin' you_ huh?,m
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet_ Cates ... not before you been a help to me.,m
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?,m
Just up the street_ the other side_ over there ... Now_ don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.,m
I may call you worse than that.,m
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....,m
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.,m
Just an expression man_ don't mean nothin'.,m
I can read a police file_ shithead_ and quit calling me Jack.,m
What gang you talkin' about_ Jack?,m
Luther was part of the gang?,m
Don't worry_ I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.,m
Okay_ let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?,m
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.,m
Yeah.,m
Shit.  I'm already sorry.,m
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away_ you're gonna be sorry we ever met.,m
No way to start a partnership.,m
You just don't get it_ do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.,m
Hey_ no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.,m
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.,m
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...,m
Listen_ it may be a little out of date. You know_ I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...,m
We're supposed to be after a killer_ not a string of hookers...,m
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.,m
This prison gives out $400 suits?,m
I'll think about it.,m
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.,m
Bullshit.,m
I got a lot to protect.,m
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?,m
I can help you_ man_ but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.,m
You're crazy.,m
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.,m
Yeah?,m
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.,m
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.,m
Yeah_ I noticed...,m
Not likely_ Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.,m
You here to write my life story?,m
Sure_ anything you want.,m
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private_ okay?,m
You got a name_ cop?,m
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.,m
Where the Christ do you think you're going?,?
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip_ huh?.,?
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.,m
Too bad_ it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed_ this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.,?
I didn't have the time.,m
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?,?
Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better_ especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.,m
What a screw-up.,?
You couldn't get to him?,?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.,m
Which one pulled the trigger?,?
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.,m
How did they get away?,?
I lost them_ that's what happened.,m
What the bell happened?,?
I'll keep it in mind.,m
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.,?
Yeah?,m
Jack?,?
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.,m
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up_ I can promise you_ you're goin' down.,?
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides_ I got a lead...,m
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one_ Jack.,?
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.,m
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?,?
Yeah...,m
Jack_ come on_ there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words_ we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know_ we all know the truth's a little different.,?
Hey_ the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.,m
Yeah_ I read the report...,?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.,m
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...,?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor_ don't give me a bunch of crap.,m
Somebody steals your gun_ you're supposed to file a report.,?
The truth hurts_ doesn't it_ buddy?,m
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...,?
Yeah.,m
That's what you say_ Cates...,?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.,?
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?,m
What?,m
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.,?
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know_ you ought to get some rest...,?
I got to wait for a call.,m
I'm heading out. How about you?,?
Bullshit red tape.,m
Nothing.,?
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?,m
Doesn't look like it.,?
Aw_ bullshit_ you heard wrong.,m
Long night_ too_ from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time_ and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman_ some jig beat the crap out of you.,?
So do you...been a long day.,m
You look awful.,?
One of  em's in the slam.,m
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.,?
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?,m
Hey ... Dick Tracy.,?
Tell me that's not the same guy.,m
Uhh ... Wong_ Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.,?
Wait a minute_ wait a minute... who's this?,m
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.,?
Who are all these?,m
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.,?
Billy Bear...,m
Shit.,m
This guy must have had a .44 like yours_ Jack. Now he's got yours.,?
I'll help you out.,m
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.,?
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?,m
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...,?
When? How?,m
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.,?
I don't know.,?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know_ like where they stashed her.,m
Ganz and Billy got my girl_ Rosalie.,?
Who gives a fuck what you think?,?
You just took a shot at me_ asshole. I think you do know where he is.,m
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.,?
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?,m
A cop...,?
That's what I always say.,m
You're impossible...,f
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.,m
Tell me.,f
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah_ never mind...,m
Where is he?,f
Three more hours...,m
Yeah_ bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag_ but it works.,m
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.,f
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin'_ shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.,m
How'd they take it back at headquarters?,f
Let's go_ Reggie.,m
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.,f
Whaddya think?,m
Oh_ yeah_ well look where you came when you were down and out.,f
Hey_ Come on_ shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.,m
When a guy hurts you_ then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees_ who knows_ he might just be irrestible.,f
So what?,m
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week_ Jack_ and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now_ if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him_ it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.,f
Come on_ they were a little old for a slumber party.,m
What makes you think they were lesbians_ or as you so quaintly put it_ dykes?,f
Jack_ it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...,f
How do you know?,m
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...,f
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...,m
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz_ no Indian.,m
You real down?,f
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...,m
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so_ but you look like shit.  What happened?,f
Don't.  We've had a hard night.,m
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...,f
Hiya_ kid.,m
Hey_ I don't believe it.,f
Fuck you.,f
Hi_ it's me...,m
Hello.,f
Just a second_ that's all!,m
Jack_ wait...,f
Elaine_ I gotta put you on hold...,m
Jack?  What was that?,f
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?,m
So am I.,f
No_ it's I'm just surprised you called.,m
No wonder you're so popular.,f
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.,m
I'm at work_ asshole.  Where else?,f
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.,f
Listen_ Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it_ you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things_ okay?,m
Elaine_ look_ I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.,m
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....,f
I get that. The job first. Everything else_ especially me_ second. I get it. I don't like it.,f
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...,m
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...,f
I didn't get burned_ two cops did. Listen_ I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.,m
Look_ Jack_ if you make everything your personal responsibility_ you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...,f
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people_ my gun is ...,m
Look_ spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...,f
Sure_ okay_ fine_ no problem... See_ there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...,m
Jack_ are you okay?,f
Yeah_ Guess it must have been a slow news day...,m
You made the front page.,f
Yeah_ one of my favorites.,m
Great place for lunch.,f
Guess people ought to know who I am...,m
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...,f
Thanks for the coffee.,m
Yeah_ for some reason_ I'm sure...,f
You sure you want me to?,m
Call me later.,f
That's the way I see it_ too.,m
You know something_ Jack_ you really are hopeless.,f
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.,f
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?,m
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.,f
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.,m
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.,f
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.,m
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.,f
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.,f
Maybe you ought to buy me one.,m
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?,m
You know_ if you let me come over to your place once in a while_ you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.,f
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good_ and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.,m
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.,f
Hey_ you know what I really think?,m
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems_ I'll take brutal indifference.,f
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.,m
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?,f
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.,m
Then I sit back and I think_ I mean_ who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar_ right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...,f
I guess he got the message...,m
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.,f
What'd you do?,m
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.,f
What's wrong with that?,m
I'm all wet.,f
That's the way I see it_ too.,m
You're hopeless.,f
Hey_ you're right.,m
I still don't think it's loaded.,f
This is a .44 Magnum_ the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?,m
I don't think your gun's loaded...,f
I don't answer questions_ I ask 'em...,m
What am I wanted for?,f
In all due respect_ he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?,f
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal_ went all the way for you...,m
That's no bull.,f
Hey_ two days with him is enough.,m
How would you know?,f
Hard man to live with.,m
Shrink major_ not a shrink.,f
Well_ I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink_ wearin' that dress...,m
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.,f
Name's Hammond_ Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.,m
Who the hell are you?,f
Alright_ I'm coming...hold on.,?
Keep stallin'.,?
What do you want?,?
Stall.,?
Shut up.,?
What do you want?  What's goin' on?,?
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.,?
Shut up.,?
Hey...,?
Sure_ right.,?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow_okay?,?
Yeah_ old times.,?
We got a lot to talk about.,?
Can't complain.,?
How ya doin'?,?
Hot?  Hey_ they're not even room temperature.,?
How hot are they?,?
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.,?
Rosalie_ you okay?,?
First_ the money.,?
Let her go.,?
You try to mess with us or go to the cops_ I promise you_ I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.,?
Come on_ you can trust me. Please.,?
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning_ that's when it opens. After that_ I'll get the money to you right away...,?
You chickenshit punk...,?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.,?
When?,?
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.,?
Billy_ go ahead_ break it...,?
Don't give me this_ we were partners.,?
Instead of worryin' about Reggie_ you better worry about me...,?
You want that Indian to snap her neck?,?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.,?
I want the money_ asshole_ what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...,?
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-,?
Surprise_ Luther.,?
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.,m
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.,?
Try and take it.,m
Give it back.,?
Yeah_ I know that_ but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?,m
This ain't a credit business.,?
Five.  On credit.,m
Five bills.,?
Don't mess with me. How much?,m
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...,?
How much?,m
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.,?
How about some ammo?,m
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.,m
You sure?,?
Naw_ right here's okay.,m
You want to go outside?,?
Not bad_ not bad.,?
How you doing_ man?,m
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.,m
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.,f
No_ I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.,m
Vano da_ mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!,f
You know exactly where they are!,m
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!,f
The case was stolen?,m
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!,f
The case..with the stones... Where is it?,m
Napoleon... small.,f
What're you laughing about?,m
At your service.,m
Corn-i-Lius?,f
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..,m
I know...,?
You are a monster_ Zorg!,m
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.,?
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.,m
Father_ by creating a little destruction_ I am_ in fact_ encouraging life!  So_ in reality_ you and I are in the same business!,?
They are robots!,m
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet_ so full of form and color.  So full of..life!,?
Follow me.. Life_ which you so nobly serve_ comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.,?
No thank you.,m
...would you like a drink?,?
Ah_ Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...,?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life_ All you want to do is destroy it.,m
Why?  What's wrong with me?,?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.,m
Personally_ they are of no interest to me_ I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...,?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?,m
I'm glad you got your memory back_ Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?,?
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.,m
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again,?
I'm fucked!,?
...We're saved!,m
That's what I'm saying.,m
And you don't know how they open_ is that what you are saying?,m
Yes_ of course_ but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.,m
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.,m
Theoretically_ yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there_ but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!,m
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?,m
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?,m
When is she not in trouble?,m
Leeloo's in trouble?,m
Yeah_ I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.,m
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.,m
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.,m
What are you doing?,m
Father_ I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.,m
Of course.,m
Good luck..,m
We have to save the world.,m
What kind of mission?,m
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..,m
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?,m
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods_ but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.,m
That's what I thought.,m
"It means_ ""Never without my permission"".",m
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?,m
I know. I was there when she arrived.,m
She's fine_ really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.,m
I might call to check up on her_ you know... to see if she's better?,m
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!,m
Dallas. Korben Dallas.,m
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?,m
She's an exception..,m
They all like this in your family_ father?,m
Uh yes_ we're cousins..distant cousins..,m
So you do know her.,m
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up_ but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!,m
You noticed...,m
He's a she!,m
The girl?,m
I brought the girl remember?,m
Who are you?,m
She dropped in on me... holding this.,m
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?,m
She's not my bride_ she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.,m
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.,m
Excuse me_ I'm looking for a priest.,m
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest_ Father.,?
What are we going to do?,m
Thank you_ Mr. President.,m
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.,?
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.,m
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?,?
Yes..thank God..,m
Is there anything that can stop it?,?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.,m
And then?,?
We have forty-eight hours_ the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.,m
That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.,?
Time is of no importance_ Mr. President. Only life is important.,m
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!,?
One more reason to shoot first eh?,?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be_ because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.,m
Later_ David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!,m
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!,?
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!,m
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.,?
Where's Leeloo?,m
Good work_ my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.,m
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!,?
Perfect.,m
They really made her...,?
I didn't know your size.,?
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...,m
Yes. Of course..,m
Uh father_ I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..,?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while_ you know.,m
What's she doing?,?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!,m
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?,?
The Supreme Being_ the fifth element is here_ in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!,m
Father_ will you please explain what's going on?,?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!,m
What is?,?
It's a miracle!!!,m
They are... with me...,?
I'm sorry_ but... the Stones...,m
I would like to have died in peace...,?
Listen_ the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.,m
I don't have time... I need to know.,?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!,m
Do you love her?,?
I'll help her_ I promise_ but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!,m
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!,?
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!,m
Yes_ and more than that... You must give her the Stones_ she's the only one who knows how to use them.,?
Leeloo... is... she's...,m
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...,?
Who?,m
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...,?
Leeloo..,m
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..,?
"5'7""_ green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..",m
So_ just how big was this fare?,?
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..,m
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.,?
Hello?,m
In your dreams! See you tonight!,?
Uh... at least fifty.,m
How many points you got left on your license?,?
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now_ not a space fighter!!,m
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.,?
I don't need one.,m
Like shit.,m
How do I look?,?
I just found a picture of you.,m
Don't exist bud.,?
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.,m
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.,?
At least_ the cat comes back.,m
Oh_ yeah_ I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.,?
I was talking to the cat.,m
I love you too Major_ but you haven't called me that since basic training.,?
Hey bud! Finger here.,?
Yeah?,m
...Leeloo.,?
Hey_  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname_ something a little... shorter?,m
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.,?
...What's your name?,m
I'm sorry_ it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently_ so I figured...,m
Eto Akta Gamat!,?
Vito Cornelius?,m
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...,?
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.,m
...Priest...,?
It there's one thing I don't need advice on_ it's how to drive.,m
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!,?
...'Scuse me?,m
Akina delutan_ nou-shan.,?
We will be ready_ Lord.,?
When EVIL returns so shall we.,?
Time is of no importance_ only life is important.,?
Knowing mankind as I do_ that could take centuries!,?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.,?
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?,?
Take them and put them in a safe place.,?
The Fifth Element...,?
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again_ you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!,?
...Ma???,m
You little sleaze bag!,?
Hello?,m
...Not yet.,m
Have you pulled yourself together?,?
Yeah?,m
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour_ blockhead!,?
Ma. If I'd won_ I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.,m
You just won a trip_ you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!,?
All I want is an explanation! I just got in_ I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged_ but other than that everything's peachy_ Ma_ thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..,m
I get it! You want to make me beg_ is that it?,?
I'm coming!. Ma_ what're you talking about?,m
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice_ I'll never forgive you!!,?
Other than that... You all right?,m
Yes ma..,m
Are you listening to me_ you ingrate!,?
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years_ 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.,?
Hi Ma...,m
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!,?
...Hello?,m
Found it?,m
6... 5...,?
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?,m
30 seconds...,?
This is a police control action..,?
I'm sorry..,m
Thanks for reminding me..,m
You have nine points left on your license..,?
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.,m
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...,?
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.,m
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..,?
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.,?
Is that all?,m
Look_ you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!,m
Nothing! Swear to God_ I didn't do nothing!,?
What did you say? What did you do?,m
Dear listeners_ your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.,?
Solid little jobs_ aren't they?,m
Fuck it! Hold tight!,m
I don't even know what I'm looking for!,?
It's like a cab isn't it?,m
You know how to fly this thing?,?
I'll be right back.,m
Like Korben_ can I have 30 seconds of your time here?,?
Not without Leeloo.,m
Maybe we oughta be going_ what do you think?,?
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.,m
He's on vacation.,?
Six to the left. One to the right.,m
Got it...,?
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?,m
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...,?
Yeah_ very big_ a giant.,m
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big_ I suppose?,?
I don't think this is a good time...,m
Oh_ yes! Do that! You treat me right_ man. Tell me all about yourself_ your roots_ your personal life_ your childhood dreams...,?
I'll take you to the bar_ after that_ you're on your own.,m
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!,?
Crystal.,?
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand_ that clear pal?,m
Uh... not really.,m
...Quiver ladies_ he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams_ his desires_ his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?,?
Does it get any better or what!,?
...Hi.,m
Oh_ yes you will...,m
Three of us will never fit in there!,?
...Sorry_ General_ but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.,m
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...,m
I thought you were divorced.,?
It's my wife.,m
What is it?,?
...Shit!,m
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.,m
Why not?,?
I'm not going.,m
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?,?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?,m
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.,?
I've had enough good news for today,m
Don't you open your messages?,?
You're the only one left alive...,?
And the third one?,m
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.,?
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.,?
Just one... why me?,m
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?,?
Where have I heard this song before?,m
To save the world.,?
What mission?,m
Major Dallas_ if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.,?
I love you...,m
Tell me...,f
Because...,m
Why?... Why would you need me?,f
Yes_ you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!,m
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.,f
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.,f
Exactly.,m
...Like love...,f
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...,m
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!,f
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation_ this time_ for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!,m
I want to sleep... forever...,f
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...,m
I'm so tired...,f
It's up to you now_ Angel!,m
...The rain falls...,f
I know all that_ Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.,m
The wind blows... the fire burns...,f
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?,m
Protect life... Until death.,f
I told you not to read all that crap!,m
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...,f
Why? We did pretty well_ wouldn't you say?,m
I'm so very sad.,f
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.,m
You're nothing but a... a...,f
It's difficult.,m
And you can't concentrate with me around?.,f
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.,m
No_ not at all!  I mean_ just the opposite_ you're... you're beautiful!,m
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?,f
Where you going?,m
OK_ you can turn around!,f
You noticed..,m
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.,f
You get that off the screen?,m
You know women normally change five times more than men.,f
Here we go again...,m
...Hoppi-hoppa.,f
Uh...,m
"Good! Do you know how we say ""make love""?",f
Apipoussan?,m
Apipoussan!,f
"I know how to say ""Hello"". Teach me how to say ""Good-bye""_ that's all I need.",m
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language_ you have to learn mine!,f
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!,m
All 900.,f
Which one?,m
Learning language.,f
Finished what?,m
What is... Make Love?,f
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..,m
"Yes! But ""love"" isn't the operative word here_ PEACE is!",m
Love...,f
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...,m
Apipoulai!,f
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.,m
Dinoine chagantakat!,f
Oh god!,m
Cornelius..,f
You hear that?,m
Uh..you're welcome.,m
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.,f
"I suppose that means ""Hi"" ?",m
Apipoulai!,f
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..,?
At least I won lunch.,m
"You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: ""It never rain every day."" This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!",?
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.,m
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!,?
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.,m
Not going to open?,?
You're welcome..,m
Thanks..,?
You gotta push the little yellow button...,m
It's not?,?
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..,m
Uh..,?
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?,m
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!,?
Been here long?,m
The cash man!,?
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.,?
Mr. President_ let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh_ who runs the center.,?
An elephant couldn't crack it.,?
This thing solid?,?
Wonderful!,?
...This is the crucial phase_ The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react_ to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever_ eh?,?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.,?
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?,?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours_ there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..,?
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.,?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.,?
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.,?
Talk English Doc.,?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200_000.,?
Have you identified it?,?
Actually only one cell survived..,?
This is all that survived?,?
How much time is left?,?
They just landed in the desert.,?
Don't worry_ Sir. I have the perfect one.,?
I want your best man on this!,?
...What do you mean?,?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.,?
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?,?
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident_ but accept our apologies.,?
I'm about to_ Mr. President.,?
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?,?
Gentlemen?,?
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.,?
Recommendations.,?
Wait or act.,?
Options.,?
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!,?
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.,?
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet_ all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..,?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts_ General.,?
Perfect_ Mr. President.,?
Is that better?,?
I can hear you_ Mr. President_ but I can't see you .,?
Staedert_ do you read me?,?
To fame.. salud..,?
Drink!,?
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..,?
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.,?
Only too well... here you must be parched..,?
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.,?
Amen..,?
..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil..,?
Lord forgive me.. they already know too_ much..,?
I'm not at the hotel!,?
Right away_ Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.,?
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.,?
Yes_ Sir!,?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.,?
Yes_ Mr. Zorg_ I hear you perfectly! So_ how was the concert?,?
How's that? Can you hear me better now?,?
...I can't wait to be among you.,?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!,?
Fine_ just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.,?
How's our deal coming along?,?
Got it.,?
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?,?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!,?
...Not far_ now.,?
No... not at all.  Where are you?,?
Am I disturbing you?,?
I just talked to her.,m
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...,f
Tom... she's dead.,f
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.,m
What?,f
Mrs. Christian.,m
Who are you calling?,f
Amy...,m
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!,f
Don't...,m
You're killing me...,f
I don't know what to say,m
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch_ you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...,f
Amy_ I'm not going to let anything happen to us.,m
You should have.,f
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.,m
No_ I don't_ because you're not telling me anything!,f
You don't understand...,m
You couldn't?,f
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.,m
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.,f
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?,f
I don't know.  I'm sorry...,m
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?,f
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.,m
Tom...,f
I can't tell you_ Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...,m
What's going on_ Tom?  What happened?,f
I'm okay_ honey_ I'm okay.  Are you alright?,m
What happened to you?,f
Just do it_ Amy_ please_ go.,m
... What's going on?,f
I'm okay.  Please_ honey_ I can't explain.  Don't use the phone_ just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there,m
What's wrong?  Are you alright?,f
Amy_ just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...,m
Tom?  Where have you been... ?,f
Amy_ it's me.  Listen very carefully..,m
Hello?,f
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.,m
Why the gun?,f
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months_ two months at most_ then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.,m
I know.,f
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.,m
I understand.,f
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.,m
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.,f
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?,m
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?,f
Sure.  I'll call the guy.,m
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?,f
I love you.,m
I love you.,f
Honey_ I'm not_ please...,m
You better not be smoking_ that's all I can say.,f
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what_ you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.,m
How's the detective business?,f
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.,m
Okay_ I believe you.,f
Well_ I'm not smoking_ okay?,m
I'm not accusing you...,f
"You know_ Amy_ I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean_ is this what I get first thing?  Before you even ""hello_"" you accuse me... ?",m
Your clothing reeks of it.,f
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.,m
What's this... have you been smoking... ?,f
Do you know how much I missed you?,m
Welcome home.,f
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?,?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.,m
What you see is what I got_ mister.,?
Snuff?,m
There's nothing harder.,?
Anything harder?,m
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five_ get one free.,?
What are these?,m
I promised him to Machine.,?
What the fuck... !,m
Nobody knows anything.,?
Dino...,m
There's nothing there_ you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up_ and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.,?
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!,m
Blow me_ you paranoid fuck_ that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?,?
I'm telling you...,m
Bullshit.,?
The loop!  The girl we did_ what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...,m
What are you talking about?,?
I just got a call... two seconds ago_ some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.,m
What do you want?,?
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.,m
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box_ in the city...,m
Bring the film_ or we kill him.,m
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...,m
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?,m
Look_ he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...,m
Friend of yours?,m
I remember him.,m
You remember Mr. Longdale_ don't you?,m
Shut up_ cunt!  Do exactly as I say_ or I'll put this arrow through your throat.,m
Look_ I don't know what this...,m
Empty the gun onto the table_ very carefully.,m
Take out your gun!,m
What are you... ?,m
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?,m
Sure.,m
Hmm?  Oh_ the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice_ aren't they?,m
What are these for?,m
They should be here any minute.,m
Where are the women?,m
Excellent.,m
Right here.,m
You brought the money?,m
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.,m
Where's that?,m
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.,m
Machine's in?,m
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.,m
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.,m
You trust me to keep your money_ but not to take your picture?,m
I'm camera shy.,m
What's the problem?,m
I'd rather you didn't.,m
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?,m
Well_ well_ I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.,m
We can do that.,m
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.,m
If it's not him_ there's no deal.,m
Machine.,m
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.,m
I'll consider it.,m
I want to watch you work.,m
And they are?,m
Five thousand now_ five thousand on delivery. Two women_ one white and one black_ as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage_ or course.  Other than that_ trusting your artistic interpretation_ I have only two stipulations.,m
Is it?,m
That's five thousand dollars.,m
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.,m
You said something about money.,m
Hmm.,m
A fellow investor.,m
Flattering.  And_ who's your colorful little chum?,m
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.,m
What can I do for you today?,m
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.,m
You betrayed us.,m
You got the guts_ tough guy?  Gonna kill us all_ is that it?,m
First things first.  You might want to watch this_ Mr. Welles...,m
... sorry...,m
Fuck off.,m
Leave him alone.,m
You're a dead man.,m
Move it_ dirtbag... !,m
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you_ you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.,m
Put the gun down_ take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.,m
Is that him?,m
It's good what you're doing.,?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?,m
It's horrible_ but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.,?
Any good?,m
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here_ but there's a coffee machine in the hall.,?
Well_ that's all I can do.  Sorry.,?
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.,m
I can give you my card_ if your clients want to call me...,?
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay_ even if that's all they hear.,m
I'm not so sure about this.,?
This doctor and wife_ they're nice people_ but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes_ not often_ but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation_ whatever.  Besides that_ the girl's probably eighteen_ so she's legal.,m
Why don't they come to me?,?
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.,m
We do.,?
I figured you share information.,m
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?,?
Few days ago_ I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia_ a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81_ which heads into Philadelphia_ started up a conversation with this girl_ she looked homeless_ seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid_ mature_ didn't have much to say_ but they got a sense she's a runaway_ so all through dinner the doctor's working on her_ trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly_ she ate her food_ excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help_ the reason I'm coming to you_ is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl_ somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive_ doing alright.,m
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make_ but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...,m
There are reasons for the way we do things here.,?
What I'd like_ very simply_ is access to your archive.  And_ now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...,m
Alright_ Tom.,?
Call me Tom.,m
What can I do for you_ Mr. Welles?,?
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?,m
"That's right_ you just stood there and watched_ because you ""felt like it.""  Almost makes you worse.",m
I never killed anyone.,m
Easy enough for you.,m
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?,m
Don't think I won't.,m
Do it.,m
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.,m
Where?  Show me where.,m
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.,m
Show me where you buried her.,m
You got absolute zero.,m
Stop talking.,m
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away_ because you got nothing...,m
Where do you think you're taking this_ huh?  Gonna be a big hero_ avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?,m
Keep moving.,m
Show me.,m
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.,m
What did you do with her body?,m
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in_ like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills_ we laid out the plastic_ put film in the camera and Machine went to work.,m
Nobody saw you bring her in?,m
What do you want to know?  You saw it_ you saw the loop...,m
Tell me what happened.,m
Made me sick_ but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.,m
You enjoy it?,m
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.,m
Because we're going there.,m
Why?,m
Show me where you did it_ on the map_ exactly where you did it.,m
Fuck you then_ you want to know?  I talked her up_ told her how beautiful she was_ told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test_ and while I'm doing that_ I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough_ I rang Dino and told him it was go time_ I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!,m
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!,m
What the fuck do you want from me?,m
What did you do_ knock her out_ shoot her up... ?,m
Something like that.,m
So... you brought Dino in_ and he brought Machine.  And_ one day_ a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.,m
It was a lot of fucking money.,m
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?,m
Thirty thousand each_ that fucking cocksucker.,m
How much did he pay you?,m
Yeah.,m
Told him you could get him a snuff film.,m
Yeah_ the fucking lawyer.,m
Okay_ we'll come back to that.  So_ six years ago a guy contacts you_ through the classifieds_ over the phone_ however he does it.  It's Longdale_ looking for a snuff film. And you_ entrepreneur that you are_ tell him you can hook him up.,m
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy_ not mine.  He shows up with his mask on_ leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.,m
I will never get tired of hurting you_ Eddie_ so you might want to change your attitude.,m
I told you_ I don't know.,m
I want his name.,m
I don't know...,m
Who is Machine?,m
What do you want?,m
Starting to recognize a pattern?,m
Fuck you!,m
Don't ask questions.,m
How'd you find me here?,m
Don't bore me with that bullshit.,m
I'm gonna kill you.,m
One million dollars_ Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...,m
What's he talking about?,m
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals_ you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.,m
What the fuck are you.. ?,m
You murdered that girl_ Eddie.  Six years ago...,m
Who is this.,m
I know what you did.,m
What?,m
I know what you did.,m
Yeah_ who's this?,m
Eddie.,m
Celebrity Films.,m
Fuck you!,m
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then_ fuck you.,?
Look_ you cocksucker...,m
The only thing wrong is the cheap_ softcore crap you're peddling_ Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?,?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place_ ever think of that?,m
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt_ and try to fucking return it?,?
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.,m
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you_ how much did he keep for himself?,m
He's lying.,m
Go ahead_ shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.,m
Give me the film.,m
You'll get it when we get there.,m
Give me the film.,m
Fuck you.,m
You almost went over your limit.,m
Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?,m
Enlighten me.,m
Isn't it incredibly obvious?,m
Why did he buy a film of some poor_ lost girl getting butchered?,m
A man like Mr. Christian_ a great man... all his money_ all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...,m
I'm asking.,m
You're asking me why?,m
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?,m
You're making me very angry.,m
Did it get him off_ huh_ watching them cut her up?  Tell me_ because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him_ sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?,m
Shut your mouth and drive!,m
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.,m
Shut up.,m
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film_ right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well_ they didn't find you one_ Longdale_ they went out and made you one...,m
Mary Anne Mathews_ that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.,m
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.,m
Except_ you're willing commit murder with them.,m
They're no friends of mine.,m
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...,m
Never mind how I found you.,m
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film_ figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?,m
I was well compensated.,m
Must have paid you a lot_ for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.,m
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.,m
So_ he sent you_ gave you the money_ his errand-boy.  And if you refused_ it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.,m
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.,m
You were the middleman_ am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.,m
Well_ whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator_ I should certainly be a party to. But_ since she feels differently_ I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.,m
That's right.,m
You are a private investigator?,m
Of what sort?,m
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate_ it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.,m
I'm listening.,m
Yes_ I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.,m
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this_ okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.,m
Look... that's awful generous and everything...,m
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.,m
What's this?,m
Nope.,m
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?,m
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.,m
What's next?,m
Devil frightened me as much as it excited me_ but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.,m
"I know if I had to pick_ it'd be ""Choke_"" or ""Devil.""",m
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?,m
You don't need to be here.,m
"Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself ""Machine_"" that's what they call him.  Machine.",m
Who is he_ his name?,m
I told you_ he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...,m
Who is he?,m
Who is this_ in the mask?  Who is he?,m
Wha... ?,m
It's cheap_ and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?,m
Oh_ come on_ man_ what are we doing in this flea bag?,m
Great.,m
It's their Presidential Suite.,m
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.,m
See ya.,m
Consider it.  Meanwhile_ dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.,m
You want me to come out there and play private eye?,m
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day_ plus expenses.,m
I'm a working stiff_ pops.,m
Well_ I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?,m
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs_ newsreel footage_ subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.,m
Alright_ I get the picture.,m
Nothing illegal_ it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...,m
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly_ but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions_ for enough money...,m
Where does he sell it?,m
You're learning.,m
Specialty product.,m
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos_ Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.,m
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?,m
Dino Velvet... yeah_ he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks_ supposed to be a real weirdo.,m
Good question.,m
So_ you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?,m
A daughter.,m
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?,m
What about me?,m
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you_ pops?,m
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?,m
Yeah_ I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck_ just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas_ beats making hamburgers.,m
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.,m
I'm not mixed up in anything_ hayseed.  What are you talking about?,m
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?,m
I don't know_ where are yours?,m
Where are your parents?,m
Twenty-five.,m
How old are you?,m
First of all_ basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky_ one_ and two_ everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But_ there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground_ where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies_ hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn_ they blister.  Other than that_ all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But_ if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible_ and vice versa_ and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.,m
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?,m
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.,m
Snuff films.,m
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish_ shit films_ watersports_ bondage_ spanking_ fisting_ she- males_ hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore_ but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up_ another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now_ with some of the S+M and bondage films_ they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line_ you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films_ but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.,m
Child pornography.,m
What you saw tonight_ we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.,m
Interesting theory.,m
You've got Penthouse_ Playboy_ Hustler_ etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then_ there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers_ directors_ porn stars. They're celebrities_ or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography_ they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream_ because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God_ Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips_ how offensive!  Nowadays_ Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict_ big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head_ literally.  Soon_ Playboy is gonna be Penthouse_ Penthouse'll be Hustler_ Hustler'll be hardcore_ and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.,m
Wake up_ pops.  Your education begins tonight.,m
... Hello... ?,m
"See you then.  Oh_ and_ don't call me ""pops.""",m
Tomorrow night_ I get off at eight.,m
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?,m
Sounds good_ pops.,m
Okay_ let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.,m
Four hundred a week_ off the books.,m
How much do you make now?,m
How much?,m
Well_ there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing_ but you can make some money.,m
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?,m
Not quite.,m
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.,m
I'm not a cop.,m
You're not a cop_ are you?  If I ask and you are_ you have to tell me.,m
Well_ whatever there is_ whoever's dealing_ however it's done_ I want to know.  I want a good look_ so if you've got that kind of connection_ great.  If not_ speak now.,m
There's not much illegal.,m
Well_ here's the deal_ Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter_ illegally...,m
Max.,m
What's your name_ if you don't mind me asking?,m
Three_ four years.,m
How long you been working there?,m
Good for you.,m
I don't know what you're looking for_ mister_ but so we're clear from the start_ I'm straight.,m
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.,m
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.,m
Came back for that battery-operated vagina_ right?  Told you you would.,m
Remember me?,m
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union_ and then where would I be?,m
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.,m
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.,m
Truman Capote.,m
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.,m
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.,m
I'll risk it.,m
It's your call_ but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.,m
Well_ it's tempting_ but no thanks.,m
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.,m
Pardon me?,m
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?,m
Yeah... guess so.,m
Big date tonight?,m
If you have a pencil and paper_ I'll tell you how to send it.,m
How will I get it to you?,m
I've got about five thousand left in cash_ but I'll need another thirty_ if you approve.,m
Fine...,m
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place_ I'll drive to you and give you an update.,m
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?,m
I hope it's nothing serious.,m
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu_ or some other wretched ailment.,m
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?,m
How are you?  Having any luck?,m
Mrs. Christian_ Tom Welles here.,m
Hello?,m
You're one hell of a detective_ Mrs. Christian.,m
You told me to look_ so I looked.,m
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?,m
Okay.,m
For a human life... murder on film_ no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks_ then put them in a safe deposit box.,m
Do you think the film could have cost that much?,m
I'm here.,m
Hello... ?,m
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.,m
You're joking.,m
Totalled together_ these five checks from five different accounts_ they equal one million dollars.,m
Okay_ I follow you so far...,m
One was for two hundred thousand_ one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand_ six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...,m
The checks were for odd amounts...,m
I'm not positive this means anything.,m
My husband never dealt with money personally_ certainly not cash.,m
Okay...,m
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information_ and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible_ Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.,m
Nothing remotely like this.,m
You've found missing persons before.,m
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...,m
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later_ anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for_ well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served_ then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.,m
It won't work like that.,m
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name_ I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them_ I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...,m
You don't have any other choice.,m
I told you I can't_ not yet.,m
You... you need to go to the police.,m
Of course.  But_ I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.,m
Will you watch it and see for yourself?,m
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.,m
I'm telling you it's not that.,m
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...,m
No.,m
Please_ believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach_ and it might seem real_ but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...,m
"Mrs. Christian... please_ will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a ""snuff film.""  But_ from what I know_ snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like_ red light district folklore.  There's no such thing_ I can assure you.",m
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been_ to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But_ I can't go to the police...,m
This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed_ and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.,m
I'm afraid I don't...,m
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.,m
Cash_ stock certificates_ and this...,m
Do you want to tell me what you found?,m
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...,m
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.,m
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it_ but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now_ that is.,m
Just curious.,m
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that_ there's never any reason.,m
Do you carry a gun_ Mr. Welles?,m
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here_ but he was always loyal to me_ and I to him.  I loved him deeply.,m
He succeeded.,m
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric_ but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.,m
Pittsburgh?,m
I'll do whatever I can to help.,m
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible_ terrible dilemma.,m
My condolences.,m
As you know_ my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.,m
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.,m
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.,m
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's_ in Harrisburg_ in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.,m
He's a lawyer.  Please_ sit_ here...,m
He's odd.,m
Thank you.,m
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea_ Mister Welles?,m
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.,m
Uh huh_ pleasure.,m
I try to be.,m
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.,m
They murdered her_ Mrs. Mathews_ I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...,m
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?,m
They killed her_ and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...,m
No... no... no...,m
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...,m
No...,m
They brought her into the room... one man_ he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...,m
Who are you?,m
Someone... some men_ they took your daughter and they drugged her_ and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...,m
Who is this... ?,m
Mrs. Mathews_ your daughter is dead. She's dead.,m
What... ?,m
She went to California_ to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...,m
What are you talking about... ?,m
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you_ her diary_ in your attic_ in silverware.  If you read it_ you'll know what I'm telling you is true...,m
I remember.  You just left...,m
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember_ I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...,m
Hello... ?,m
What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds_ right?  She's all I think about_ and I've learned to live with that.  But_ you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose_ between her being out there_ living a good life and being happy_ and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.,m
It's been six years.,m
I think about it everyday.  But_ every time the phone rings... every single time_ I still think it's her.,m
Yes.,m
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?,m
You're probably right_ and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this_ and you can kick me out of your house if you want_ but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?,m
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...,m
Will you let me look?,m
How... how can you say that to me...?,m
If the police focused their search in her room_ her belongings_ well that'd be only natural_ but they may have been looking in the wrong place.,m
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...,m
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it_ but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...,m
I don't know.  I think so.,m
Do you think the police did a good job?,m
There wasn't one.  The police looked.,m
It's not really my place_ but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See_ I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run_ they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.,m
What?,m
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.,m
You should be.,m
No.,m
Are you religious?,m
We're all like that.,m
Doesn't make much sense_ does it? When everything's happy_ when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God_ you don't bother.  Then_ something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.,m
Okay.,m
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...,m
Of course.,m
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?,m
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.,m
I had to ask.  I apologize.,m
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it_ that's all. Christ_ there's times when it still seems like I can't either.,m
I didn't mean to...,m
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked_ but there wasn't anything happened like that_ never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...,m
You have to forgive me_ but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?,m
It got to be too much for him.,m
Why do you think he did it?,m
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...,m
September 4th_ 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.,m
Yes.,m
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about_ tell me_ but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?,m
I don't know.,m
What was she running from?,m
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.,m
She just seemed... depressed... ?,m
No.,m
So_ she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go_ before she left?,m
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey_ chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight_ pissing in a plastic bottle_ pardon me_ because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous_ huh?  And the guy who hired you_ he has a hair-lip_ dandruff and crooked teeth_ and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating_ and you don't blame her.,m
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore_ except on TV.,m
That's exactly what I am.,m
They hired you.  You're like_ a private detective?,m
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is_ please know_ I'm not here to create any false hope.,m
Well_ I'm following up on your daughter_ Mary_ height; five four_ weight; hundred ten pounds_ brown eyes_ blonde hair.  Born April 24_ 1976.  Missing June 11th_ 1992.  A runaway_ that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?,m
No.,m
Right_ Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?,m
Neil... Neil Cole.,m
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...,m
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected_ functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records_ see if there's anything they missed_ anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days_ before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago_ uh...,m
Yes_ but...,m
I'm sorry_ let me explain_ the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive_ not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?,m
I don't understand_ who are... ?,m
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days_ I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.,m
Hello_ Mrs. Mathews_ my name's Thomas Jones_ I'm a state licensed investigator...,m
Yes... ?,m
I'll do what I can.,m
She was the kindest_ sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh_ I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time_ all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents_ if you think it's appropriate?,?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?,m
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it_ till you showed me her picture.,?
Her belongings?,m
Those are her belongings.,?
What is this?,m
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.,m
Do you know what happened to her?,?
Yes.  I remember her.,?
You... you do?  You're sure? Please_ Sister_ will you take another look_ make sure...,m
Yes... I remember Mary,?
Certainly_ Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.,m
Yes_ Mister Welles_ thank you.,?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...,m
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter_ but what can you do?,?
No_ sir_ he is not.,m
None too discreet_ is he?,?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day_ saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report_ and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant_ I know.  I apologize...,m
Certainly_ sir.,?
Yeah_ I know the spiel.  If you could bag it_ I'll be on my way_ thank you.,m
I'm required by state law to inform you that_ while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items_ it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...,?
Okay.  Fine.,?
No_ you may not.,m
Alright.  May I have your phone number_ area code first?,?
Cash.,m
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.,?
Okay_ I'll take it all.,m
Then we'll stay up together.,?
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.,f
We'll figure it out.,?
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...,?
I can't go back to sleep again.,f
Yeah_ or turn you into toast.,?
It is...was. It's a zapper_ it might help me stay awake.,f
Hey_ since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.,?
I can't find him.,f
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?,?
It was bad.,f
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?,?
Kristen...,f
You alright?,?
What?,f
Kincaid and Joey died last night.,?
What's wrong?,f
Alice_ you think you can leave?,?
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.,?
Rick...I can't.,f
Look_ you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.,?
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.,f
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.,?
I don't want to.,f
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.,?
What?,f
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?,?
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder_ but it wasn't.,?
Kristen_ what happened?,f
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.,?
You what?,f
When they're all you have_ you kinda become an expert.,f
How'd you learn so much about dreams?,?
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.,f
Great_ you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?,?
No really_ it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.,f
Sounds like a game show host to me.,?
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?,f
You could do worse.,?
I love to dream_ I just hate ones about my dad.,f
Yeah_ I'm not so sure.,?
I'm sure they're around.,f
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God_ I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.,?
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.,f
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test_ and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...,?
Then you saw him_ too?,f
That obvious_ huh?,?
You've been up all night?,f
What?,?
We have matching luggage.,f
Ohhhhbaby_ I am dead on my feet.,?
I know.,f
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.,?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.,f
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.,?
You in a hurry?,f
Save it for later.  Come on!,f
You look great!,m
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her_ like the others.,f
What the hell was that?,m
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...,m
Here we are.,f
You know_ I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.,m
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.,f
It's okay_ we're just about there.,f
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.,m
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before_ but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.,m
You just feel sorry for me.,f
Hey_ you're not alone.  We have to stop him_ I'm with you.,m
He's going after Debbie_ I gotta stop him.,f
Who?,m
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.,f
Then what else can we do?,m
Yeah_ right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.,f
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?,m
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.,f
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.,f
Is there something we can do?,m
Not really.,f
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.,f
Alright_ let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?,m
Three days.,f
How long have you been awake?,m
The story is_ the deaths you can't argue with.,f
No offense_ or anything_ but it's kind of hard to swallow.,m
Look_ you know why_ you just don't believe me.,f
Extra money_ huh?,m
I've been working double shifts.,f
Kristen's story really got to her.,m
No_ don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!,f
In her dream?,m
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...,f
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy_ and he's coming back for seconds_ thirds_ and fourths.,f
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.,m
I know.  Uh...Alice.,f
Tell him I was looking for him_ okay?  I'm Dan.,m
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.,f
You're his sister_ right?,m
No...,f
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...,f
Enough of that crap.,?
It was Freddy.,f
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.,?
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.,?
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.,f
Alright_ I think I see salvation...,?
Rick_ please.,f
What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway_ if I'm next_ watch your back.,?
About Freddy?,m
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it_ if I'd listened.,?
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.,m
Been up with Alice.,?
She knew she was gonna die.,?
Hey man_ we're all sorry...,m
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there_ you're dead for real.,?
Nice neighborhood.,m
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen_ they hunted him down; roasted him alive.,?
So?,m
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.,?
So what's up?  What'd I miss?,m
Let me talk to you.,?
I don't get it.,m
Excuse me_ ladies.  I'll just be a moment.,?
Hey_ Rick!,m
Earth to Alice...,?
T-T-Thanks Alice...,m
Mother_ you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...,?
Honey_ we went over this in therapy.,?
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score_ it's his fucking banquet_ and I'm the LAST COURSE!!,?
I'm sorry honey_ but...,?
Your distraught.  It'll help...,?
What's wrong with me?,?
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop_ honey.,?
Well Mom_ I'll tell ya_ when two of your friends die the same day_ you let me know what it does to your appetite.,?
Something the matter with the cuisine?,?
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.,?
It's okay_ babe.  We're with you.,?
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.,?
I'll tell you later.,?
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.,?
I though Freddy was just an old town story.,?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.,?
Oh God!  He killed them!,?
What is it?,?
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn_ it's avoid-all-contact-day.,?
What?,?
Avoid-all-contact-day.,?
Something wrong with the stairs?,?
Don't worry_ honey,?
You don't get it_ he's after me...,?
You just stay put.  You need rest.,?
I gotta get out of here.,?
You had a nasty bump.,?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?,?
Feeling better now?,?
You're not taking my baby!,f
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.,?
"What are you talking about?  My ""condition""?...",f
In your present condition_ Alice_ we're worried about your ability --,?
And ours.  It's our grandchild.,?
Look_ I appreciate what you're offering_ but no.  He is my responsibility.,f
What I what?  Well_ I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.,f
Frankly_ dear_ we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?,?
It's okay_ Dan,f
Excuse us_ dear.,?
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.,?
But how...?,f
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.,?
What do you mean?,f
He's inside you_ where he hides.,?
Where is he?,f
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.,f
Mommy...?,?
My friend_ with the funny hand.,?
Who says I don't like you?,f
Who said I...wait_ what?,f
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?,?
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.,f
She doesn't want me around,?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.,f
No...,?
Is that who you're waiting for?,f
Been having bad dreams.,?
Hi_ you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?,f
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.,?
How did you know that?,f
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.,?
My name is...,f
It's lonely in there_ in my room.,?
Shouldn't you be in your room_ Jacob?,f
Huh?,f
Hey...wake up.,?
Me too.,f
There you go.  Love you.,?
You're right.,f
You don't dream him up_ he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...,?
Yeah...I guess.,f
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.,?
No.  Well_ not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.,f
About him?,?
He'll show up.  C'mon_ what's really wrong?,?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.,f
Okay_ babe.  What's the matter?,?
I know.,f
They're coach seats_ but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer_ hon!,?
The tickets.,f
Sorry_ babe.,?
Jesus!  Don't do that!,f
Hi_ beautiful.,?
Now.,?
But Dad --,f
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.,?
I've got to go.,f
Alice!,?
No_ I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.,?
You disappointed in me?,f
Since my little girl became a mom...,?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?,f
Alice...,?
Very funny.,f
Sobering...,?
How was the meeting?,f
Daddy_ he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.,f
I'm so sorry_ honey...,?
It's just across the park.,f
You sure you don't want a ride to work?,?
Thanks for everything_ Dad.,f
To take a picture.,f
Where are we going?,?
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.,?
Dad!,f
No.  A deal's a deal.,?
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.,f
"I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you_ ya know.  ""The drunk showed up""_ that kind of thing...",?
I was afraid you weren't coming.,f
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.,f
He sure loves to stay awake.,f
So did Dan.,f
You do good work_ Alice.,f
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!,f
But how are we gonna --,f
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.,f
What?,f
If they actually bothered to bury her.,f
You think that's the place she's buried?,f
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.,f
Are you alright?,f
That's the only reason you're alive...,f
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...,f
Goddamn it_ Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.,f
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?,f
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not_ Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it_ who will??,f
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!,f
Krueger is reality.,f
I am your friend_ and I'm worried sick about you.  But_ you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.,f
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...,f
I really think you need to calm down now_ okay?,f
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.,f
Oh_ Alice...no.  Honey_ I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...,f
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.,f
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?,f
Why don't you two stick to reality.,f
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams_ but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?,f
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.,f
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.,f
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.,f
What's that got to do with it?,f
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.,f
Did everyone call everyone?,f
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.,f
There aren't any little boys on your floor.,f
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob_ the one who looks kind of sad?,f
Alice_ it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.,f
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams_ but not anymore.  He's found some other way.,f
Yeah_ before they revoke his diploma.,f
Good to see you again_ Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.,f
No_ the Dan part was nice...,f
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window_ girl.,f
Had kind of a long night.,f
Hey_ what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.,f
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.,m
I don't understand.,f
No shit.,m
Poor woman...,f
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool_ huh?,m
But I've seen her grave.,f
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.,m
Meaning?,f
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself_ so they thought.,m
No_ it's our problem_ Mark.  If I don't deal with this_ they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?,f
That's their problem.,m
They think I'm nuts.,f
Then we'll find another way.,m
I couldn't do that_ Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No_ I want him.,f
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger,m
Where are you going?,f
I don't know!,f
Whoa_ slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that_ leave the planet?,m
What_ you named it already?,m
My baby!,f
Who's Jacob?,m
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.,f
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.,m
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.,f
Maybe it was her mother who killed her_ with all that Polly Perfect shit.,m
Nobody thinks that.,f
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?,m
Mark!,f
Then get out!,m
She must've fallen asleep at the table...,f
I thought about that.,m
I'm very fucking sorry_ but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?,m
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...,f
Yeah.  I'm just aces.,m
Mark_ are you okay?,f
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.,f
I've got to write some of this down.,m
Well we gotta do something!,m
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.,f
Greta_ come on.  One burger with me?,m
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.,f
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.,m
Give up_ Mark_ it's hopeless.,f
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?,?
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.,m
Oh_ he was this ancient guy I read about who like_ killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.,m
Who?,?
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.,m
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?,?
That club sucks_ they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.,m
Pimples_ heartburn_ cellulite... and no modeling career.,?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!,m
My undying love.  Have some.,m
Next life.  Oh_ what's that?,?
Yeah_ when are you gonna come to your senses?,m
All of us.  Right?,f
Bottom line_ Alice.  Anybody_ supernatural or not_ that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.,?
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.,?
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.,f
I want to talk about the baby.,?
Stop saying that_ it's bullshit.,f
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me_ and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.,?
Naah_ I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?,f
Have another one_ sounds like you need it.,?
That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.,f
Yeah...,?
All right kids_ I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...,f
Makes you look like a nun--,f
These things are wild...  What do you think?,?
He invited me to his house last night.,m
You_ too?,f
Stick around_ please?,m
It's okay.,f
I can't listen to this.,f
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe_ just maybe_ someone or some thing killed her_ I'd like to hear about it!,m
Mark...,f
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days_ does that strike you as particularly normal?!,m
Faint.,m
Vomit?,f
Two hours a day_ six days a week.,f
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.,m
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>_ won't we?,m
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you_ the Skipper_ Dave_ Kent_ Sir Ian and my father -,m
I don't know.,m
But if they <u>do</u>?,m
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here_ after all.,m
Which is the one - we have to worry about?,m
Yes?,m
They're so remote - cold - beautiful_ the stars.  But now - I wonder -,m
I'd sooner swim!,m
However our ideas disagree_ as I've said before_ I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there_ in the Lungfish_ or you don't get there -,m
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!,m
That's enough_ Holloway.  I've told you before_ wearing boards on your shoulders_ and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !,m
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?',m
Unidentified Flying Objects.,m
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father_ to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared_ <u>long</u> ago!,m
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars_ and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!,m
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?,m
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!,m
You're really a mixed-up oddball_ aren't you?,m
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is_ and I'm staying here!,m
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!,m
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage_ <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...,m
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -,m
You 'trade school boys' are all alike_ aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is_ ipso facto_ a coward!,m
Your father can be in Nome_ Alaska_ tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter'_ and take you off_ or the Shark can put back into Nome...,m
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?',m
Dead?  Matter of fact_ he's much better. He's left the hospital.,m
My father!  He's not - ?,m
Your 'out.'  This came for you. ,m
What is it?,m
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!,m
You could train someone else.,m
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?,m
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question_ his coming along.,m
How is he - ?,m
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack_ two days ago.,m
I should have suspectcd_ when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.,m
What's goin' on in here_ Lad? What - ?,m
Dave - !,m
Oh it does???,m
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.,m
I'm with <u>you!</u>,m
Well?,m
We'll have to look for them later.,m
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?,m
Somewhere down there?,m
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?,m
The sound again?,m
You hear that?,m
Let's get back to work_ and maybe we <u>will</u> be_ soon.,m
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!,m
You know - it <u>is</u>?,m
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!,m
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F,m
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -,m
Listen!  Hear that?,m
Yeah?,m
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.,m
I think you're right.,m
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram_ the Shark can pull herself loose!,m
How about that! The bow drove half through her_ but she sealed herself right up.,m
Not <u>alone</u>_ you're not!,m
You all wait here.  I'm going inside_ take a look.,m
Reef and I can take the Explorer down_ clamp it around the eye_ and ---,m
'Us?',m
You've got to let us try_ Skipper --,m
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!,m
We're stuck tight!,m
Sounds like it!  Distress call_ from a small freighter_ between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday_ then...nothing.,m
Cyclops?,m
'His' side?  I've seen it_ all right. A nice_ bright yellow!,m
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?,m
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest_ sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh_ he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him_ all the same.,m
A lot of people think like that.,m
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school_ be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead_ do-gooder_ and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!',m
So?,m
One of the finest men_ and officers_ alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.,m
I guess.,m
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy_ didn't he?,m
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>,m
Huh?,m
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!,m
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!,m
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?,m
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?,m
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -,m
So they caught up with you_ too?,m
Reef!,m
Helen.  I appeal to you -,m
But Julie's a nice girl_ and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!,m
Now_ Dave Old Buddy_ you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately_ in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -,m
We hope!,?
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.,m
With their underwater experience_ they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms_ and flare pistols --,?
The frogmen?,m
You better take Powell and Carney with you --,?
Right at our one-eyed friend!,?
What course_ Skipper?,m
What???,?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing_ and caught our torpedo!,m
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!,m
Course and speed?,?
I...don't know!,m
What about down?,?
Seems to be all around...,m
Is there any way out of it?,?
Right_ Skipper.,m
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.,?
What????,?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!,?
Why do you say that?,?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.,?
Something wrong?,?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?,?
All internal repairs completed_ and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.,?
Yes_ Griff?,?
Excuse me_ Skipper---,?
What about time...?,?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.,?
Anything ---,?
Excuse me_ Captain - there may be one last_ desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...,?
Radiation level...constantly rising...,?
Now they feel it...down below.,?
That's wonderful_ Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!,?
Wonderful!,?
We read you!  Go ahead_ Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!,?
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.,?
All ready?,?
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!,?
There's got to be an explanation!,?
As we near the Pole...,?
What direction does the system indicate?,?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!,?
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....,?
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and_ as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?,?
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!,?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....,?
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?,?
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?,?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!,?
...above Murmansk_ and Finland.,?
High-intensity arcs will burn_ submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...,?
Under <u>water</u>?,?
It doesn't seem possible_ but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?,?
Minus three.,m
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?,?
Nothing we can do_ now.,?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!,m
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?,m
What?,?
Suppose there's an atmosphere_ of some kind_ inside Cyclops?,m
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!,?
It's the screws_ Skipper.  At our declination angle_ running in reverse_ they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.,m
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....,?
We can <u>ram</u> him!,?
But - what can we accomplish?,m
That's what I said!,?
Right <u>at</u> him?,m
Thirty-four seconds!,m
What's the running time?,?
Take a look.,?
You're sure it's Cyclops?,m
After torpedo room:  Report!,m
Determine extent of damage_ immediately.,?
I think I should have joined the Air Force!,m
What do you think?,?
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!,m
Huh?,?
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?,m
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -,?
Who with?,m
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you_ Reef -  You'll have to share quarters_ this trip.,?
I met Dr. Kent_ once.,m
I did go.  Just back.  Reef_ these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt_ and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec_ Commander Richard Holloway.,?
Thought you were going to Washington_ Skipper.,m
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!,m
Obviously.,?
To navigate_ won't you have to... see your way?,m
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --,?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?,m
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.,?
I have selected you_ to return with me - along with several other specimens_ for study.  We will examine you and the others_ discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.',?
Why?,m
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.,?
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?,m
I am afraid not.  Therefore -,?
He did!,m
Your friend was to remain where he was!,?
Swell!,m
- for horrors like yourself?,m
My mission is to study various solar systems_ and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -,?
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you_ when the others couldn't?,m
Point of view is everything. To us_ <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.,?
That's a <u>face</u>???,m
Come where?,m
Remove your weapons_ Commander. And come here - alone!,?
All right - go to it.,?
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.,?
Toward the Pole!,?
Due north.  At five knots...no_ six!,?
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!,?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.,?
Or_ perhaps_ until he gets us?,?
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes_ <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!,?
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt_ itself!,?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven_ who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.,?
I'll be another!,?
Well_ I'll be - !,?
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...,?
See what?,?
Thank you.,?
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.,?
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two_ you won't recognize this town.,f
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.,m
No.,f
Twombley involved?,m
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain_ Wade. $364_000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.,f
What is the Northcountry Development Association?,m
This is from three years ago. Some difference_ huh?,f
As a mater of fact_ yes. LaRiviere.,m
Has anybody offered to buy it?,f
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.,m
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?,f
You don't believe me?,m
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.,f
...if Jack told the truth_ he could be free by the time he's my age.,m
You know Jack Hewitt_ the kid I work with?,m
Who?,f
Evan Twombley_ the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.,m
Who?,f
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about_ I'm talking about murder. Among other things.,m
Always has been.,f
Alma_ I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.,m
Well_ you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.,f
Yeah_ sure. Why? I got this damned tooth_ I got a few things bugging me_ like everybody else. But I'm okay.,m
Are you alright_ Wade?,f
No. Black.,m
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?,f
You got yourself a computer_ Alma.,m
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.,?
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.,m
Chub says you're fired.,?
Tell me.,m
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?,?
Yeah. I know about that.,m
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that_ Wade.,?
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.,m
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --,?
Same old shit.,?
What are you boys up to?,m
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.,m
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --,?
Oh.,m
Hard to say. If we go for custody_ depositions_ psychiatric evaluations_ it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn_ assuming they're unduly restrictive_ it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.,?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?,m
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.,?
Yes.,m
No_ not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree_ see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill_ right?,?
It looks pretty hopeless_ don't it?,m
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.,?
This spring.,m
How soon?,?
I plan to. Soon.,m
It would help if you were married_ if there was someone at home while you work.,?
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.,m
That was me.,m
We bought you.,m
You can't buy Wade off.,m
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.,m
Shit! What are we gonna do?,m
He's on to us!,m
No_ of course not. Just say it_ that's all.,m
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer_ do I?,m
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts_ you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.,m
Not exactly. I mean_ he never paid me.,m
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day_ anyhow_ right?,m
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him_ Wade?,m
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck_ then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was_ deader'n shit. Called it right in.,m
You see it?,m
Yeah.,m
I hear Twombley got shot.,m
You heard the news.,m
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.,m
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck_ Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.,m
Deers have ears too.,m
Sun's gettin high.,m
This way.,m
Yeah.,m
Safety on?,m
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm_ I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.,m
What happened?,m
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck_ shit luck.,m
Hmm.,m
They said.,m
Really.,m
"Pitcher. ""Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk.""",m
Oh.,m
Double A. New Britain.,m
You played for the Sox?,m
Drafted by the Red Sox.,m
Yeah?,m
I used to play ball.,m
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.,m
I'm okay.,m
Wonderful!,m
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.,m
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.,m
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer_ a dead one_ not a cripple or whatthefuck.,m
Mmm.,m
You take care of your end_ kid_ I'll take care of mine.,m
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen_ especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.,m
You think so.,m
You might not kill it.,m
Yeah.,m
If you get it?,m
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten_ kid_ there's another hundred bucks in it.,m
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?,m
Damn straight!,m
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30_ 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for_ ain't it?,m
Guaranteed_ eh?,m
Don't worry_ Mr. Twombley_ I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine_ snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.,m
It's not enough snow_ not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there_ kid.,m
What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.,m
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up_ Jack_ and you're digging wells in the snow.,m
Open the door. We're late.,m
Why don't you quit now_ you want out so bad?,m
Open the door_ will ya?,m
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.,m
Lawford?,m
I'm fucking out of here.,m
He sure as hell won't.,m
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.,m
Yeah.,m
There's your old twenty-gauge_ and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell_ Jack_ I guess you deserve it. Right's right.,m
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense_ man.,m
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.,m
What the fuck you telling me_ Wade? I never seen the guy get shot_ I told you that.,m
Saw him do it?,m
What?,m
Sure you did.,m
Well_ I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.,m
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.,m
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.,m
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering_ that's all. What'd he do_ to shoot himself_ I mean?,m
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing_ playing cop?,m
On your sleeve.,m
What blood?,m
Where'd you get the blood?,m
Yeah.,m
You stayed away?,m
The ambulance guys lugged him up.,m
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.,m
A half mile in_ along the old lumber road.,m
No_ I mean whereabouts.,m
In the chest.,m
Where'd Twombley get shot?,m
Piece of fucking cake.,m
Aw_ shit_ she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack_ I got to get back_ get back to town. Move this thing_ will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there_ okay?,m
Shit.,m
Bastard's got his high beams on.,m
Right!,m
Yeah_ he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.,m
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.,m
Like you and Gordon?,m
Gordon_ he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy_ I'm his boy.,m
How'd you get the job?,m
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good_ though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill_ of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.,m
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.,m
Got a job first thing in the morning_ first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --,m
Not here.,m
Some job. Here_ have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems_ but everybody's got problems. ,m
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.,m
Relax_ Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?,m
I thought I told you to move that truck!,m
Got you for -- 450_ 500 bucks? ,m
No brag. Just fact.,m
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?,m
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.,m
Don't mind if I do.,m
Okay_ let's go home_ then.,m
I want to go home.,f
Jill_ please_ it's alright. Nothing happened.,m
Oh.,f
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.,m
You're a policeman.,f
I know.,m
That's illegal_ you know.,f
You can't.,m
I want to go home.,f
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought_ you know_ we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy_ like we used to.,m
What are you sorry for?,f
Please don't cry. Please_ honey.,m
Fine.,m
Okay.,f
Nothing_ I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.,m
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?,f
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today_ though.,m
Same thing_ Daddy. Mommy says --,f
You can't have nothing_ Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?,m
Nothing.,f
What do you want_ then?,m
No.,f
C'mon_ we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?,m
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.,f
How about a Big Mac?,m
Oh.,f
Grandpa. My father. It's his.,m
Pop?,f
It belongs to Pop.,m
It's pretty old.,f
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.,m
Are we going in this?,f
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?,m
Dad.,f
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes_ tell her I'm up here.,f
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.,m
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.,m
Yes.,f
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?,m
Yes.,f
"That's all you got to say? ""Yes"".",m
Yes.,f
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.,m
Well_ I guess I am. I planned this_ I planned all this_ you know. I mean_ it's sort of pathetic_ but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon_ we're gonna call her before she leaves.,m
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy_ don't be mad at me.,f
Yeah. Yeah_ right_ I'm mad. What'd you tell her_ for Christ sake?,m
See_ I knew you'd be mad.,f
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?,m
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.,f
Jesus_ why?,m
Yes.,f
What? You called Mommy? Just now?,m
I called Mommy.,f
Jesus. Listen_ Jill_ tell you what. Tomorrow morning_ you still want to go home_ I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.,m
I don't want to be here. Don't worry_ I love you_ Daddy_ I do. But I want to go home.,f
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.,m
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.,f
No what?,m
No.,f
Some party_ huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.,m
Oh_ Jesus_ come on_ will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.,m
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.,f
It's fun.,m
It's stupid.,f
What then?,m
It's not that.,f
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.,m
I don't want to.,f
Go on_ Jill. Some of those kids you still know.,m
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.,f
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?,m
I just think you used to be bad.,f
What are you talking about?,m
I bet you did lots of bad things.,f
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.,m
But it's not funny now.,f
To us it was.,m
Was it funny?,f
Well_ yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals_ me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins_ soaping windows. Stuff like that.,m
Did you do that when you were a kid?,f
I guess they're stupid.,m
Yeah. It's stupid.,f
Break stuff?,m
You know.,f
Do what?,m
Why do they do that?,f
Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See_ they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.,m
I don't care. They're out.,f
Those are the Hoyts.,m
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.,f
Yeah.,m
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge_ Daddy.,f
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry_ remember.,m
Yeah_ you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is_ Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you_ and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.,m
The key_ Wade.,m
You two_ don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ_ Jack_ don't you see that?,m
Wade_ you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.,m
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more_ sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.,m
Could be.,m
You and Mel Gordon?,m
Maybe.,m
I won't. You interested?,m
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.,m
Want to buy?,m
What's the difference? Take my truck_ take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?,m
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.,m
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.,m
You? Why?,m
Wade_ that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.,m
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.,m
So?,m
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.,m
Nothing_ Wade_ I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.,m
What do I have to do for it?,m
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car_ fix the clutch.,m
On what you pay me?,m
You ever think of getting a new car_ Wade?,m
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.,m
You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?,m
I'm fine_ fine.,m
How you holding up_ Wade?,m
Well_ right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do_ then you can get bugged on your own time.,m
Yeah. A few things.,m
Something bugging you?,m
It ain't done_ if that's what you mean.,m
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.,m
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided_ I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.,m
You want me to follow them to Littleton?,m
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.,m
Like hell.,m
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.,m
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.,m
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.,m
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.,m
Yes_ Wade_ I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.,m
You mean Twombley?,m
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?,m
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay_ I assume.,m
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?,m
Twombley_ Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon_ you drive. We'll take my truck.,m
I figured you already heard.,m
Huh?,m
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.,m
What's the hurry?,m
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.,m
Fuck you.,m
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.,m
I'm not saying that.,m
You don't want the extra police pay?,m
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me_ you and your Selectman friends.,m
Don't go playing policeman.,m
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.,m
Huh?,m
His son-in-law damn near killed me.,m
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.,m
Where's the plow?,m
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.,m
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.,m
Tomorrow_ Gordon.,m
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.,m
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!,m
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.,?
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?,m
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.,?
No problem. Look_ I...,m
Hi honey.,m
See. Get your boots.,?
Yeah_ lots.,m
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?,?
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.,?
It's just...,m
We've done all our talking_ Wade.,?
We should talk.,m
No_ not anymore. It's too... it's too far.,?
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?,m
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal_ it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look_ treating her like some tragic victim or something?,m
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.,?
I don't want her to go_ Lillian.,m
Oh_ Jesus_ lay off_ will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already_ so lay off a little_ for Christ's sake.,m
She's grown up some_ hasn't she?,?
Yeah.,m
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there_ with whatzizname?,?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?,?
Me and Jill_ we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out_ I guess_ from not knowing some of the new kids --,m
Where's Jill?,?
Lillian!,m
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake_ Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt_ so they probably got some big weekend party planned.,m
I still don't understand --,?
Mel Gordon.,m
Good. Who?,?
I know who it is.,m
Did you get his number?,?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.,m
Are you okay_ Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?,?
Don't be silly. Hi_ Jill.,f
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me_ I can see that.,m
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.,f
Going somewhere_ Margie?,m
Look_ that's temporary_ believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days_ my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.,m
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning_ didn't you?,f
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.,m
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?,f
Jesus Christ_ Pop_ let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.,m
What happened?,f
Wade.,f
This is nuts.,m
I don't know for Christ's sake!,m
How?,f
Of course! I would've heard.,m
Think they're alright?,f
Strange.,m
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.,m
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?,f
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.,m
I know your parents.,f
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?,m
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?,f
Good.,m
Alright. I'll think about it.,f
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything_ just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?,m
You've been married twice --,f
I've been thinking about it_ that's all.,m
Oh_ Wade.,f
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea_ Margie_ because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately_ I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.,m
Then... I guess you have to.,f
I'm her father -- supposed to be_ but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes_ I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.,m
Don't you think_ do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?,f
It's nice.,f
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.,m
What way?,f
Yeah_ but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face_ like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now_ this way.,m
You knew me as a kid.,f
I can see what you looked like as a kid.,m
But not now.,f
No. Not for money. But_ if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up_ you know.,m
You wouldn't have done anything like that_ shot someone for money.,f
No_ I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid_ what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.,m
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?,f
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley_ Boston union official_ probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.,m
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides_ who would pay him?,f
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.,m
Jack doesn't need money.,f
Money.,m
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that_ shoot Twombley on purpose?,f
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley_ instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.,m
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid_ but it's like_ when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore_ he changed. Now he's like everyone else.,f
I'm sure_ I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.,m
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...,f
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it_ actually.,m
Jack's sort of sensitive_ I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.,f
Okay.,f
Tonight. Let's get together.,m
Call me.,f
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing_ this divorce thing_ rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody_ especially not kids. And I pay her.,m
No you don't. You're pissed_ that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her_ tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.,f
Yeah. I mean that.,m
You don't mean that.,f
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?,m
I'm sorry.,f
Forget it.,m
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?,f
Said what?,m
I'm sorry about what I said.,f
Yeah.,m
You okay?,f
Yeah.,m
You okay?,f
See you tomorrow_ maybe.,m
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean_ c'mon_ Wade_ give me a break.,f
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party_ give me a call_ okay? I'm off.,f
Okay. She's fine.,m
How's she doing?,f
For a while.,m
New hat?  Jill's up_ I see.,f
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.,?
Can --?,f
It makes me sad.,?
Is...? She's dead then?,?
When did she die?,f
Coffee's perked.,?
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade_ would you do that?,f
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.,?
You're not using it today?,f
There's a furnace.,?
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.,f
You get the hell out of my house now_ asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call_ and I'm pissed enough to do it now!,?
Yes. Here's your ticket.,m
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.,?
Don't give me a hard time_ Mr. Gordon. I'm just --,m
You're talking about a goddamned ticket_ from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?,?
Don't ever put your hands on me_ Mr. Gordon.,m
Hold on!,?
Yesterday morning_ you passed a stopped school bus_ which was flashing its lights_ then you--,m
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it_ Whitehouse? You're nuts?,?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.,m
What the hell are you talking about?,?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon_ when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons_ I don't call ahead for an appointment.,m
I said_ 'Next time_ phone ahead.',?
How's that?,m
Whitehouse. Next time_ phone ahead.,?
Can't it wait_ then?,?
Oh_ no. No_ it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.,m
Something about my father?,?
Well_ yeah_ I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.,m
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.,?
Well_ yes_ I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father_ Mrs. Twombley.,m
He's asleep. We were up very late.,?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering_ is your husband here?,m
Who are you?,?
No_ he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.,?
He got his deer yet?,m
Well_ I guess -- that's what he said.,?
His office. You mean my old office.,m
Wade_ I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt_ he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.,?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich_ you dub.,?
Jillie_ you want a cheese grilled sandwich?,m
No_ I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.,m
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley_ who the fuck is he_ anyhow?,?
Where... how'd you hear that?,m
The other guy.,?
Jack?,m
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.,?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.,m
You talked to Jack?,?
Marg! You got orders!,?
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed_ Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.,m
Marg!,?
"Aw_ c'mon_ I was only saying there's something wrong with ""Home Made Cooking""_ that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.",m
This town sucks.,?
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea_ good for you_ good for the town. Real modern too.,m
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here_ you gotta find fault with it.,?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.,m
What?,?
It don't look right.,m
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants_ you know.,m
Take care_ Wade.,?
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.,m
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house_ my money_ my truck -- stolen!,?
Crawl!,m
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch_ you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!,?
You and me.,m
Bang!,?
Yeah.,m
Everything you know is from me.,?
Call it what you want.,m
Love! I'm made of love!,?
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?,m
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you_ you mean sonofabitch!,?
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.,m
You! By Christ_ you -- I know you.  Yeah_ you goddamn sonofabitch_ I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!,?
You think you can take me now? Come on_ try.,?
Pop_ for Christ's sake!,m
Come on_ smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.,?
Listen_ it's no big deal_ Pop.,m
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.,?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?,m
In the living room.,?
Is there something wrong with the phone?,m
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.,?
Yeah.,m
She's coming.,?
Where's Ma?,m
Yeah.,m
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?,?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.,m
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?,?
You remember Margie Fogg?,m
Sleeping.,?
Jesus_ Pop_ how can you stand the cold_ dressed like that? Where's Ma?,m
You no-good pup!,?
Nothing.,m
What was that?  You got something to say_ say it! Say it!,?
Atta-go.,?
Just do it.,m
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally_ turn off that TV!,?
Rolfe.,m
Take care of the little things first_ the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt_ get your car back_ call a dentist_ for God's sake_ and get your tooth pulled_ don't trust the locals_ get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.,m
To help_ Jack_ of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches_ the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus_ Rolfe_ whose side are you on?,m
For what?,m
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.,m
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.,m
Wade_ are you alright?,m
Then you accidentally see your body_ or your face_ or whatever_ and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man_ I know_ and how incredibly pissed I was at him_ and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that_ and the Goddamned truck going through the ice_ not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.,m
That's what you think.,m
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult_ but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.,m
Well_ I never heard that one.,m
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.,m
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.,m
It wasn't me. I wasn't there_ but I heard about it. When I heard about it_ it was about Elbourne.,m
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?,m
It may have happened_ but not the way you said.,m
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?,m
I hate to disappoint you_ but I don't think it happened.,m
Yeah.,m
I was thinking about that story you told me_ about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.,m
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history_ remember?,m
Right's right_ goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?,m
Not particularly.,m
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody_ his own father-in-law_ and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?,m
Shit_ around here_ you shoot somebody in the woods_ you say it was an accident_ you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.,m
A hunting accident is perfect.,m
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.,m
Here's my theory. Twombley_ unaware of illegal union loans or whatever_ starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.,m
Yeah_ the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did_ didn't I?,m
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name_ Mel Gordon?,m
I don't know. You tell me.,m
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?,m
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.,m
Money.,m
Motive. You gotta have a motive.,m
Well_ your friend_ I think. Jack Hewitt.,m
Then who shot him?,m
That it wasn't an accident.,m
Which is?,m
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.,m
Find them everywhere. ,m
Want to know what I think happened?,m
I guess it was an accident_ like everybody thinks.,m
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?,m
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk_ and he's always drunk now. After_ we'll hide the keys.,m
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here_ he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot_ it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department_ by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose_ but it's worth it.,m
Well_ do you still plan to get married?,m
What about her?,m
What about Margie?,m
Yeah. I forgot.,m
No thanks. I don't drink.,m
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?,m
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?,m
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do_ I guess.,m
No_ no_ I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little_ but I haven't bit.,m
Haven't you already done a bit of that?,m
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days_ Rolfe_ and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.,m
Get some sleep.,m
Yeah_ I guess.,m
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.,m
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know_ 'cause of Jill.,m
What happened?,m
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.,m
Who?,m
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.,m
How was she?,m
The night before the shooting.,m
Huh?,m
Lillian was here. In Lawford.,m
They were out deer hunting_ right? Jack probably heard the gun go off_ then came back and found the body.,m
Well_ it was an accident.,m
You think Jack shot him?,m
No shit.,m
Twombley.,m
Who?,m
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.,m
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.,m
No_ not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.,m
Wade_ it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's_ but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.,m
Yeah_ I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.,m
There was something. It happened up your way.,m
Yeah_ brother_ look_ I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley_ Evan Twombley?,m
Wade?,m
Rolfe.,m
Jim... for godsake!,?
Daddy. Daddy_ please...,?
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.,?
Yes dear?,?
Mom?,?
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.,?
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.,?
That's not really the point.,?
Some kids were teasing you?,?
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.,?
Your father never means to be so...,?
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.,?
No_ it's okay.  After all_ he is the President_ right?,?
I'm sorry_ honey.,?
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.,?
I know_ Mom.  It was great... really.,?
We'll talk at home.  You know_ most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.,?
Back at The Fishbowl?,?
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...,?
Mom_ just this once_ give it a rest.,?
Alice...,?
Hey Joey_ how `bout a cocoa_ double whip cream.,?
Don't you even want to ask?,?
I'm sure he's busy.,?
You don't want to say hi to your father?,?
Yeah_ no duh.,?
Well_ you aren't the President_ dear.,?
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.,?
You are a resilient man_ Mr.,?
He didn't leave us.,?
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.,?
Fuck off_ you stupid asshole.,?
That's the way of the world_ little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?,?
The woman you shot. She was my friend.,?
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.,?
Smart for your age_ eh? Top of your class? Tell me_ do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?,?
Yeah_ I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.,?
So_ you study world events_ little one. That's good for a girl your age.,?
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.,?
No_ thank you. The gunfire did that.,?
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.,?
I don't drink coffee.,?
Okay_ I'm slowing us down.,m
There they are!,?
It's okay_ honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.,m
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...,?
Been better_ Dad... You?,?
How you doing_ sweetie?,m
Alice... I...,m
Daddy...,?
Daddy...,?
Alice!,m
How `bout a hug for the old man.,m
It was the experience of a lifetime.,?
How was...  ...the ballet?,m
Hey_ you guys back already?,m
Oooooh_ I'm good.,?
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.,?
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.,?
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.,?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.,?
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.,?
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.,?
Did we warn them off?,?
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.,?
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice_ then cuts out.,?
It's cut.,m
Okay_ you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires_ just to your left. Do you see them?,?
Okay_ it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.,m
Pop it open. There should be a red switch_ toggle it up.,?
Got it.,m
Do you see the maintenance panel?,?
Uh_ Tower_ we got a problem up here.,?
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.,m
Aw_ man. You're torn up pretty bad out here_ sir. Do you have any elevater control.,?
Lemme take a look.,?
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.,m
Just stay on my wing_ sir. I'll take you all the way in.,?
Uh_ we got a problem here.,m
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.,?
How we doing_ Colonel?,m
Stay cool.,?
Got it.,m
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?,?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.,?
I'm doing what I can.,m
Who's flying the fucking plane?,?
He's busy being dead.,m
Put your pilot on.,?
You read my mind.,m
Mr. President_ it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.,?
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.,?
U.S. Pilots_ this is Air Force One.,m
That's game_ set_ and match. There's nothing to do_ except call the Chief Justice.,?
I prefered the terrorists.,?
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane_ their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.,?
This doesn't make sense.,?
They aren't answering their hails.,?
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.,?
Walter_ if you have a point_ make it.,?
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.,?
We don't know that.,?
He's dead then. They must have killed him.,?
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.,m
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.,?
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.,m
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.,?
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.,m
It was a good ad-lib_ sir.,?
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?,m
Sir_ you threw out page two.,?
To swear you in as President.,?
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?,?
If fired upon_ tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.,?
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.,?
If challenged_ our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.,?
Like any good poker player_ they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.,?
They still have the President_ it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?,?
Okay. Also_ I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert_ and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.,?
I hate to be pragmatic_ but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.,?
But they start executing hostages in,?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.,?
Can we do that?,?
Does your office have anything to add_ Mr. Dean?,?
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.,?
My loyalty was never to my country.,?
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.,m
Because it is my duty.,?
Why?,m
Yes_ Mr. President.,?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?,m
Ga get it.,?
That's affirmative.,?
Roger.,?
Air Force One_ please reduce speed to 250 knots.,?
Air Force One_ acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.,?
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.,?
About goddamn time.,?
Air Force One_ this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.,?
No! If we land this plane anywhere else_ we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud_ evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.,?
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.,?
Where are we now?,?
Not even close. Hell_ we can't even make Syria or Iraq.,?
We're not going to make it.,?
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.,?
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.,?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless_ of course_ you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.,?
How?,?
Well it worked.,?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.,?
why did they do that?,?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.,?
A secret service agent. It must be.,?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.,?
Who did this?,?
Any of us?,?
Nine.,?
How many others killed?,?
Dead.,?
The rest of the secret service?,?
Sir_ this plane carries the President of the United States.,?
We've already been inspected.,?
Copy_ Air Force One.,?
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower_ alert air traffic_ Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.,?
Tower_ here.,?
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?,?
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.,?
Stand by.,?
Romeo Tango Zulu_ do you have the President? Over.,?
Romeo Tango Zulu_ copy One the television_ graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.,?
Tower_ Air Force One has been boarded.,?
Very good. Thank you_ Ms. Mitchell.,?
You're pointing a gun at me.,?
Scared. We're scared.,?
How are your fellow hostages feeling_ Ms. Mitchell?,?
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.,?
And what is it you do_ Ms. Mitchell.,?
Maria... Maria Mitchell.,?
*                     Please tell me your name.,?
Thank you.,?
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.,?
Conference rooms_ though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.,?
And all these rooms here?,?
I guess it depends on your perspective.,?
A dubious distinction_ no?,?
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.,?
This is a remarkable aircraft.,?
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC_ as we call it_ can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.,?
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.,?
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.,?
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.,?
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?,?
Three...,?
Jim...,?
Four...,?
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.,?
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.,?
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.,?
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.,?
Say something dear.,?
No.,?
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.,?
So is this.  Come now_ you're upsetting the little one.,?
That was war.,?
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster_ but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq_ did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too_ yes... but they were not your people.,?
How can you? I mean they're people.,?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.,?
Why? Do you enjoy it?,?
Yes,?
Do you have to be so brutal?,?
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.,?
My husband is a very courageous man.,?
I know he left you behind.,?
What do you know of my husband?,?
Or you will do what_ Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband_ on the other hand...,?
Leave my daughter alone.,?
Come on_ Alice.,?
Now_ or he dies_ please.,?
Cooperation. If you try to escape_ you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.,?
What do you want with us?,?
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish_ and bound to die.,?
Hold on_ Alice.,m
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.,?
If you put down the gun_ I promise not to drop her on the way down.,?
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!,m
There goes your ride.,?
One thing I've learned as,m
The taste of defeat is bitter_ no?,?
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality_ that is a virtue. In politics_ however_ that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to,?
Someday_ you'll regret my nature.,m
Good. Good.,?
Yes_ I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.,m
You'll do it?,?
Stop.,m
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.,?
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.,m
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.,?
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.,m
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill_ perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.,?
Over my dead body.,m
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate_ I wondered if you would be so kind.,?
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.,?
Finally_ we can bargain.,?
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.,?
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper_ waves off Lee_ and reads it as she talks.,?
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.,?
Twenty minutes?,?
Okay_ Gentlemen_ we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee_ go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.,?
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.,?
That isn't necessary.,m
Sir_ we stay with the President.,?
Yes_ sir.,?
I'll not going without my family.,m
Got it.,m
Eighteen thousand feet_ sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.,?
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.,m
They've cut communication_ and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.,m
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...,?
We've already played our cards_ Major. There's no turning back.,m
Gravity.,?
Mr. Caidwell_ the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?,m
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.,m
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.,?
They've gotta be joking.,m
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.,?
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.,?
Flying the plane.,m
What are you doing?,?
Both of you.,?
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.,m
Please... don't start with me.,m
I don't know why you stayed.,?
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?,?
Look on the bright side_ hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.,m
Well_ they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.,m
How did your speech go?,?
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.,m
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.,?
I'll make it up to you_ I promise.,m
I wish it were that easy...,m
But that's the point_ Jim. We're right here.,?
I miss you. And I miss her.,m
What?,?
You know what?,m
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do_ Rose_ tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?,m
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her_ or me_ in weeks.,?
She's a big girl.  She understands.,m
For godsakes_ Jim_ slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.,?
Rose_ I don't have time for this.,m
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.,?
No_ Mr. President.  It can't.,?
Can't it wait?,m
May I speak to you for a moment?,?
Actually_ sir_ you could be that someone.,?
Someone should give you a raise.,m
White House Situation room.,m
Where are we sending it?,?
No. I thought about this_ Mr.,?
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.,m
The fax machines.,?
Excuse me?,m
The fax machines.,?
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?,m
Please_ Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?,?
But this is different_ sir. You're the President.,?
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now_ all of America becomes a target.,m
and if that means negotiating...,?
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.,m
They're still alive_ but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.,?
Did they say anything about my family?,m
Two... THREE. GO!,?
But...,m
One.,?
We're handling it_ sir.,?
Where's my family?,m
We're under attack.,?
What's going on?,m
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.,m
Thank you for calling the white House...,?
Look lady_ I don't have time for games. Just put the....,m
Okay... if you're the President_ when's your wife's birthday?,?
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.,m
Sir_ the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life_ before I have this call traced.,?
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.,m
Yeah_ right.,?
This is the President.,m
who can I say is calling?,?
Okay listen_ listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?,m
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.,?
We're hooked. Hove into position.,m
WE'RE HOOKED!,m
DO YOU SEE TEEM?,m
IT'S OPEN!,m
They better. Fuel's almost gone.,m
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.,m
Twenty-five years.,m
How long's it been since you flew_ sir?,m
Shit.,m
Iraq? Shep_ you're fired.,m
Iraq_ sir. We're over Iraq.,m
A MiG? Where the hell are we?,m
My god. I think that was a MiG.,m
Sir...,m
Shepherd.,m
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?,m
Mr. President_ how the hell did you get on board?,m
Okay.  Hey_ pumpkin_ you'll tell me all about it later_ right?,m
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.,m
Yes_ sir.,m
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.,m
That's my job.,m
You give me ulcers.,m
We'll just say it was in bad taste.,m
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward_ please.,m
Did we tape the Duke game?,m
Sir_ the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.,m
It's bait.  Don't take it.,m
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.,m
Other way around_ sir.,m
This is a crime bill_ Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides_ Shep_ I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.,m
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.,m
I might still have a few chips left.,m
With all due respect_ sir_ maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.,m
He and the NRA don't like the wording.,m
No_ no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?,m
You wanna knock of f?,m
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.,m
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.,m
Commissioner_ Aquarius.,?
Kruger_ Sagittarius.,?
I was asking McCrosky_ Commissioner.,?
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...,?
What's the story?,?
I was reading too.,?
Forget it.  I was reading.,?
You've made your point_ Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs_ pull Oveur!,?
I told you_ leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...,?
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.,?
That just doesn't make any sense.,?
That's right_ Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.,?
I just wish it was that simple.,?
What?,?
Commissioner.,?
You handle your front office people_ I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.,?
Bud_ get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.,?
And what do the boys on the board know about safety_ Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.,?
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.,?
Commissioner_ we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.,?
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.,?
What is it_ Mary?,?
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn_ can I ask you a personal question?,?
Felt like a large asteroid.,?
Yes I did...,?
Did you feel that?,?
You better take this.,?
Sir?,?
Dunn.,?
You better check on it_ Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.,?
Sir_ I've got an overload in disposal unit four.,?
You better check it_ Unger.,?
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four_ sir.,?
Accelerators down.,?
Shut down accelerators.,?
Dunn.,?
Oveur.,?
Kramer_ the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.,m
Ted_ the lever!,f
Compute!,f
Now!,m
Set!,f
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!,m
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.,m
Not when I'm with you_ Ted.,f
Are you afraid?,m
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.,m
What will happen to him_ Ted?,f
That's right -- premature ejection.,m
You mean...,f
Sit down_ Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.,m
Simon just ejected!,f
That might be the news we've been waiting for.,m
I just want you to know_ I love you Ted and always will.,f
Well_ Elaine_ this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.,m
That was very well put_ Ted.,f
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives_ Kruger_ and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.,m
I mean until we start to burn up.,f
Not now_ Elaine.,m
Ted_ we've only got ten minutes.,f
Ted_ please be careful.,f
Elaine_ I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.,m
Ted_ there's no time to explain.,f
Elaine_ what's going on?,m
Ted!,f
Elaine!,m
Ted_ a toilet's not going to kill anyone.,f
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship_ Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.,m
I'd use the word insane.,f
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.,m
The word is sick.  Ted -- very_ very_ very sick.,f
What word would you use_ Elaine?,m
I've never used the word insane_ Ted.,f
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.,m
Ted_ get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.,f
Elaine_ I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.,m
We can't go back.  We had something very special_ but it's all over.,f
Elaine_ we have to go back.,m
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.,f
Elaine.,m
Ted!,f
Not now_ Elaine!,m
Ted.,f
I've got it_ Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!,m
What are you doing_ Ted?,f
Let me by_ Elaine.,m
Ted_ we're taking off!,f
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.,m
Ted!  What are you...?,f
Goodbye_ Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.,f
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.,m
If that's the way you want it.,f
No goodbyes_ Elaine.  Just go.,m
Ted_ you must remember what the doctor said_ the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way_ Ted_ I'm leaving you for Simon.,f
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years_ that's all he says.,m
And when are you going to realize_ Ted_ that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.,f
Elaine_ when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.,m
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.,m
Who's that_ Ted?,f
Eat this spaghetti_ Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.,f
Ted_ I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game_ Ted.  He might have his faults_ but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.,f
Elaine_ what happened to us?,m
Ted_ please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.,f
Elaine.,m
You're as bad as the rest of them_ Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!,m
Let's relax tonight_ just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it_ with spaghetti.,f
There's nothing wrong with me!,m
Ted_ you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.,f
Ask Simon.,m
Ted_ what's wrong?,f
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and_ Kurtz_ you know why.,m
But_ Ted_ the invitations have already gone out.,f
It's got to be stopped!,m
That's not important now_ Elaine.  We have to talk.,m
Te...!,f
Elaine.,m
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.,?
Is he making any progress_ Doctor?,f
The brain is an amazingly complex organ_ Elaine.,?
Is that a good sign_ Doctor?,f
You can be gentle with him_ Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.,?
I mean for Ted.,f
You can eat balanced meals_ exercise_ and take Geritol.,?
What can <u>I</u> do_ Doctor Rumack?,f
So you see_ our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.,?
The human brain is a highly complex organ_ Elaine_ perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area_ this area_ here_ here_ here_ under here_ here...,?
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon_ Doctor.,f
Simon_ what are you saying?!,f
Maybe.,m
Simon_ I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.,f
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon_ what happened to the man I thought I loved?,f
My career is shot.,m
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.,m
Can't we change course?,f
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.,m
Simon_ what's happening?!,f
Roger.,m
Simon_ I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.,f
That's my girl.,m
I think so.,f
Have you got it straightened out now?,m
Don't be too long.,f
Meet me onboard_ sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.,m
So mentally ill?,m
Simon_ why has he become so... so...,f
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself_ he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.,m
No_ I've been excited before.,f
I guess this is a first for you.,m
I'm so excited_ Simon.,f
Frank's the best pilot in the program.,m
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.,m
But_ darling_ they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.,f
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way_ sweetheart.  But after the wedding_ no more complicated computers for my little girl.,m
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you_ Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.,f
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.,m
Simon.,f
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.,m
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.,?
No_ I mean you can do it from the cockpit.,f
I'd rather sit down for this one_ Elaine.,?
You can do it from up here_ Captain.,f
Roger.,?
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.,f
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?,?
I don't think we have any alternative_ Captain.,f
Yes_ sir.,f
Elaine_ ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.,?
There's nothing wrong with me_ Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.,?
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.,f
Life support check.  Elaine_ it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.,?
Request; life support systems check.,f
Systems check positive.  Look_ Elaine_ I...,?
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.,f
You have great tits.,?
Go ahead.,f
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?,?
That's okay_ ROK.,f
Elaine_ I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.,?
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit_ Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.,?
That's not possible.,f
Negative.,?
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.,f
Negative.,?
"Intermitant failure in scan mode ""R"". Analyze.",f
Look_ a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway_ she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!,?
No more kids yelling_ 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?,?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.,?
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world_ new kids to play with.,?
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury_ Dad?,?
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.,?
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.,?
We'll have to check_ Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.,?
Will Scraps be able to sit with us_ Dad?,?
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back_ Jimmy?,?
Yeah.,?
He's a boy dog.,?
Sure.,?
Can I hold him?,?
Scraps.,?
Come on up_ Jimmy.  Say_ that's some puppy.  What's his name?,?
What...?,?
All right.  Here.,?
Okay_ Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.,?
I don't want to hear that word!,?
Joey_ what's more important_ the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.,?
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...,?
Take this_ Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.,?
I'm sure.,m
You're sure?,?
That's right_ Joe.  Now_ no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.,m
What?,?
Joe_ the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance_ not life insurance.,m
I don't want to live anymore.,?
Joe_ you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.,m
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?,?
Captain_ the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.,?
Poached!  Not over!  Over!,?
All right_ Captain Oveur.  Over.,?
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.,?
Just poached on toast.  Over.,?
Poached <u>and</u> over_ Captain Oveur?  Over.,?
No.  Poached.  Over.,?
How would you like your eggs_ Captain? Over.,?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice_ Mary.  Over.,?
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.,m
What should I say?,?
No_ a bomb.  Now_ as discreetly as possible_ I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.,m
A b...,?
He's carrying a bomb.,m
Sixteen 'C'_ why?,?
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?,m
Yes_ sir_ commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.,?
Whenever your're ready_ Captain.,m
Captain Oveur_ your navigator_ Mr. Unger_ and your first officer_ Mr. Dunn.,m
Good to be aboard_ gentlemen.,?
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?,?
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.,m
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.,m
Mr. Kurtz_ I presume.,?
Captain Oveur?,m
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.,?
Ah_ yes_ the Institute_ I'm familiar with it.,?
Let's go_ Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.,?
It's a privilege to meet you_ sir_ I'm familiar with all your work.,?
Yes.,?
Say_ isn't that Dr. Barrington_ the world- renowned agronomist?,?
Thanks_ but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.,?
You folks need any help?,?
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.,?
Don't try to stop me!,m
You can't go in there!,?
Death_ death.  How about the first Thursday in March_ ten o'clock.,?
All right_ it's a matter of death.,m
You'll have to be more specific than that_ sir.,?
No_ dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.,m
Do you have an appointment_ sir?,?
I have to see Bud Kruger.,m
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...,m
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!,m
Then Elaine was right.,m
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.,m
Kurtz_ you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?,m
Striker.,m
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.,m
You're tired_ Striker_ overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.,m
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.,m
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist_ Striker.,m
That's right_ Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.,m
Are you on the Mercury mission?,m
Well_ we laughed.  We laughed all the time.,m
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.,?
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.,m
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.,?
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.,m
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.,?
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.,m
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.,?
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.,m
No.  I mean your relationship.,?
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.,m
Do you want to talk about it.,?
No_ I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.,?
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working_ you can't force it.,m
You've been hurt.,?
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.,?
I'm familiar with your work_ Doctor. You'll have to excuse me_ I have to go.,m
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.,?
Not Dr. Barrington_ the world renowned agronomist?,m
You don't have to thank me_ I'm a nurse. This is my father_ Dr. Barrington.,?
Uh... oh_ thank you.  It's nothing.,m
Excuse me_ are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?,?
That's a very nice compliment_ and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.,?
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye_ I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.,?
No. I'm all alone.,?
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well_ is there a message you'd like me to give someone?,?
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.',?
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.,?
You know_ here we are having coffee together_ and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.,?
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is_ nobody ever asked me.,?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work_ you didn't have time for marriage.,?
Well_ I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.,?
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?,?
Well_ after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.,?
After my wife died_ I felt like a fifth wheel. You know_ so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away_ I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.,?
No. I'm from Washington_ D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.,?
Well_ it really wasn't a vacation. You see_ I'm a teacher in the New York City school system_ and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?,?
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?,?
No_ thank you. I take it black. Like my men.,?
Thank you. Cream?,?
Ah_ won't you sit down?,?
That's very nice of you. Thank you.,?
I happened to be passing_ and I thought you might like some corfee.,?
Shep_ no! He gets so excited when new people are here.,?
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.,?
Shep_ no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.,?
Yeah_ something like that_ but as I say_ they didn't have time to tell me very much.,?
Something about a plane with no pilot?,?
Well_ to tell the truth_ they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.,?
Shep_ sit...sit! So_ I understand you've got a real emergency down there.,?
Oh_ yes. Come in_ Paul. Rex will be right out.,?
Hello_ I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.,?
Excuse me_ Doc_ I've got a plane to land.,m
"And the last thing he said to me_ ""Doc_"" he said_ ""Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys_ tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then_ Doc_"" he said_ ""but I won't smell too good. That's for sure.""",?
George Zipp said that?,m
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!,?
Surely there must be something you can do.,m
I won't deceive you_ Mister Striker. We're running out of time.,?
Yes_ everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?,m
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?,?
Chicago_ the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?,m
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.,?
Let's see. Those are the flaps_ that's the thrust_ this must turn on the landing lights.,m
Elaine_ I haven't time to put this gently_ so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.,?
Well_ I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force_ but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!,m
I <u>am</u> serious_ and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?,?
Surely you can't be serious.,m
Can you fly this airplane and land it?,?
Both pilots!,m
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.,?
What is it_ Doctor? What's happening?,?
No_ I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!,?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?,?
Well...not for another two hours.,?
Can't you take a guess?,?
I can't tell.,?
Captain_ how soon can we land?,?
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane_ but who didn't have fish for dinner.,?
No. No one that I know of.,f
Well...,f
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly_ I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now_ is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?,?
No.,f
Elaine_ you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?,?
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.,?
Just how serious is it_ doctor?,f
He had fish_ too.,f
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?,?
Doctor Rumack_ Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases_ and they ate fish_ too.,f
He had fish.,f
What did he have?,?
Yes_ yes_ I remember. I had lasagna.,?
Well_ we had a choice. Steak or fish.,f
What was it we had for dinner tonight?,?
Certainly.,f
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.,?
A hospital? What is it?,f
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.,?
Yes. Yes_ of course.,?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?,f
That's right.,?
Sir. Excuse me_ sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?,f
Uh-huh.,f
See them_ Elaine?,m
The gear is down.,f
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.,m
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.,f
Yes?,m
Ted...,f
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.,m
But Ted_ you're the only...,f
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this_ the shit's gonna hit the fan.,m
What happened_ Ted? What went wrong?,f
Rats! I've lost number three.,m
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.,f
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.,m
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.,f
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.,m
And a little ice!,f
And a little ice.,m
Rain.,f
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.,m
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!,f
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.,m
Ted_ I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.,f
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!,m
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.,m
What's his problem?,f
Be patient_ Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.,f
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.,m
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted_ Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?,f
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.,m
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?,f
Headquarters!? What is it?,m
You got a telegram from headquarters today.,f
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!,f
That's the way I've always wanted it to be_ Elaine.,m
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did_ it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.,f
I remember everything. All I have are memories.,f
Elaine_ just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?,m
I love you.,f
I love you_ Elaine.,m
Oh_ Ted_ please be careful. I worry about you so much.,f
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.,m
What's the matter?,f
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.,f
Elaine_ I've got to talk to you.,m
Ted_ what are you doing here?,f
It's too late_ Ted. When I get back to Chicago_ I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.,f
But if you'll just give me...,m
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities_ different jobs_ and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.,f
You expect me to believe that?,m
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.,f
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could_ they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.,m
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?,f
Elaine_ not yet. I promise you I really can change.,m
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.,f
Look_ you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.,m
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!,f
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?,m
I have been patient and I've tried to help_ but you wouldn't even let me do that.,f
I know things haven't been right for a long time_ but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient_ I can work things out.,m
I just don't want to go over it any more.,f
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine_ I've got to talk to you.,m
Ted!,f
Elaine!,m
Find out if there's a doctor on board_ as quietly as you can.,?
I think so_ but I've never seen it so acute.,f
Airsick?,?
Who wants to be first?,f
Hey_ we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.,?
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.,?
We'd better get back now.,f
Hello.,?
We have a visitor.,f
Good-bye_ darling.,?
Good-bye_ darling. I love you. I love you_ darling.,?
Good-bye_ darling.,?
Bill! Bill! Good-bye_ Bill.,?
So long_ darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.,?
Oh_ Bill_ I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.,?
Good-bye_ darling.,?
Every day.,?
You promise you'll write.,?
Oh_ Bill_ I'm going to miss you so much.,?
All right_ he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.,?
He's right on the heading.,?
Watch your altitude_ Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.,?
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!,?
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner_ throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.,?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.,?
Runway niner. It's the longest_ and directly into the wind.,?
Did you decide on a runway yet?,?
Yes_ Captain?,?
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?,?
Here.,?
Oh Jack_ I'm so warm. I'm burning up.,?
How ya doing_ honey?,?
What is it?,?
Oh_ I can't stand it.,?
Well_ it wasn't all that I had hoped.,?
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?',?
Yeah_ I think he is.  Hey_ Fred!,?
Jack_ isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.,?
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.,?
...and that you don't really try_ except during the playoffs.,?
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.,?
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.,?
Denver Control_ this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.,?
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.,?
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah_ Clarence_ according to my calculations_ with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.,?
I think you should go back to your seat now_ Joey. Right_ Clarence?,?
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!,?
I'm sorry_ son_ but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.,?
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!,?
Okay_ this is one of my favorites.,?
Oh_ I'd love to.,?
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.,?
I'm Lisa. Oh_ you have a guitar!,?
I'm Randy.,?
Hi!,?
Oh_ it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.,?
Yes_ of course. We both had fish. Why?,?
Well_ the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?,?
Oh_ Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something_ please?,?
Yes?,?
I will_ but Jim won't.,?
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?,?
All right. But just remember_ my name is Roger Murdock.,?
No_ he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.,?
No_ why don't you take care ot it?,?
Do you want me to check the weather_ Clarence?,?
Roger_ Roger. What's our vector_ Victor?,?
We have clearance_ Clarence.,?
Huh?,?
Roger.,?
Huh?,?
Roger.,?
Hi_ Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor_ this is Roger Murdock.,?
Sorry_ Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.,?
Of course.,?
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.,?
Oh yes_ I saw. Poor child.,?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...,?
Yes?,?
Excuse me_ Sister?,?
Thank you_ Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.,m
Mr. Striker_ the passengers are ready.,?
Would you go up_ please?,?
Well_ I flew in the war_ but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.,m
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?,?
The cockpit? What is it?,m
Excuse me_ sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...,?
No. No thank you.,m
Excuse me_ sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?,?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.,m
Do you feel all right_ sir?,?
Thank you.,m
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.,?
Yeah...,?
You okay?,m
Your voice is saying no_ but your body is saying yes.,?
I like my horizons narrow.,m
I think you're just a little scared now_ about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on_ that curiosity and fear_ swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.,?
There's lots of things I haven't done_ but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.,m
A virgin.  I find that very arousing...,?
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.,m
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while_ let me entertain you? It's Matt_ right?  Now tell me the truth_ have you ever... made it... with one of us?,?
Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.,?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant_ somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.,m
Look_ I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.,?
You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...,?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?,m
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.,?
Show me.,m
In there.,?
She did_ did she?  Well_ she was wrong.  Excuse me_ I have to change.,?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.,m
He's not here.  Why ask me?,?
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.,?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes_ and I am--,m
That's right.,?
You are Cassandra?,m
I may be an asshole_ but at least I'm a real detective_ not some outer shit space thing.,?
Lay off_ asshole.,m
Well_ if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders_ big guy?,?
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid_ Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.,m
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here_ moron!,?
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...,?
You don't have squat.,m
Jesus_ Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it_ okay?,?
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?,m
No_ Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...,?
Move a finger_ Harcourt_ and you're history...,m
That's right.  He and I_ along with seven or eight others.  Listen_ gentlemen_ I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately_ at the moment_ I'm overdue at another function.,?
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh_ Newcomer real estate thing.,m
Yes_ I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.,?
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.,?
I'm Sergeant Sykes_ and this is Detective Jetson_ Los Angeles Police Department.,m
Yes...,?
William Harcourt?,m
Do it!,?
Here?,?
Kill them both.,?
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.,?
When we picked him up_ he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.,?
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.,?
He didn't recognize me.,?
This is becoming a serious breach of security.,?
That cop_ the human_ he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.,?
You look very good.,m
How do I look?,m
You understand that.  But how many others will?,m
But there's no more drug.,m
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.,m
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?,m
We can't let him get away.,m
I never thought I'd say this_ but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.,m
Tell me about it...,m
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up_ you appear to be dead_ but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...,m
Harcourt is dead.,m
... It's Harcourt.,m
What is this?!,m
Do what?!  George-- ?!,m
No!  We must do this alone.,m
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.,m
What's this about_ George?  I know that look.,m
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still_ I gotta tell you_ George_ for a quiet guy_ you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.,m
With Harcourt and Kipling dead_ I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.,m
Ss-ai!,m
Shit!,m
Fuck procedure.,m

Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?,m
The fifty kilos_ Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.,m
George_ c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.,m
Stay out of this_ Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.,m
George_ uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...,m
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?,m
Uh_ George...,m
No_ George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence_ ya know?,m
If the drug is here_ we must destroy it.,m
Okay_ George -- we gotta play this real smart.,m
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.,m
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter_ with his chemistry background_ must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader_ through the nightclub_ established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--,m
I must trust you_ Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.,m
George... look me in the eye... George_ you don't ever lie to me again.,m
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.,m
Jesus_ this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?,m
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.,m
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?,m
We all did.,m
We?  You've taken it?,m
"Like your cocaine_ I suppose.  The ""high"" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.",m
How potent?,m
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.,m
The hell it isn't_ when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something_ and not sour milk_ either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?,m
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.,m
No secrets_ goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on_ you're gonna tell me now!,m
You must leave me alone on this.,m
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits_ and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me_ George_ you're bad at it.,m
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?,m
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...,m
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers_ all killed the same way -- execution style.,m
Nothing.,m
What was that about?,m
Thank you.,m
It's all right_ George.  It's cool. Just wait here_ all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.,m
Stop the car!,m
Come on_ you won't have to get near the water.,m
Please_ I must get out here.,m
Why?,m
Stop the car.,m
Come on_ let's go_ dude.  Surf's up!,m
To the... to the beach?,m
Well_ let's roll_ George.,m
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.,m
George_ she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life_ remember?,m
She's going to divorce me.,m
A man_ a human_ was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...,m
Where'd you get this?!!,m
Yeah_ go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep_ don't you?,m
I'm going home.,m
Don't count on me_ George.  I never had any ideals.,m
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.,m
You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you_ in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world_ full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another_ but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.,m
No shit_ Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet_ for chrissakes.,m
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.,m
Ta ss'trakyona'...,m
Your health...,m
Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See_ that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise_ and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada_ huh?,m
In the other man's rectum.,m
"... and so_ and so the doctor says_ ""If this is the thermometer_ then where'd I leave the pen?""  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George_ work with me_ I always get a laugh with that one. Look_ if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand_ then where's his pen gotta be?",m
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...,m
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off_ then...,m
I appreciate your honesty_ George.,m
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.,m
It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell_ but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.,m
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.,m
Was.  Divorced.,m
You are married?,m
Yeah... I know the routine.,m
My wife?  She worries about me.,m
So_ she keeps you on a pretty short leash_ does she?,m
Through his ass.  Next time you see him_ tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.,m
I believe he is probably lying.,m
When will Strader return?,m
We were chasing you because you ran_ you dumb son-of-a-bitch.,m
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.,m
Who is he?,m
Yeah_ that's it.  Say it slow.,m
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.,m
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.,m
"Ss'loka'.  It means literally ""small but intelligent creature"".  It loses much in the translation.",m
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?,m
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.,m
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?,m
This is mole.  It's good.,m
Which one is that?  Raw what?,m
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for_ to adapt to hostile environments.,m
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?,m
Yeah_ sure.  I knew that...,m
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time_ a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm_ here_ will produce the effect I think you were looking for.,m
In the camps_ we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...,m
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?,m
From quarantine_ when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.,m
You know that guy?,m
Stay back!  I'm okay.,m
Matthew_ you don't have to-- .,m
That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you_ Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office_ ya know?,m
Your mother mates out of season.,m
Tell me.,m
Screw me?  That can't be right.,m
Screw you.,m
I'll handle it.,m
But I-- .,m
Back off_ George.,m
Uh_ Matthew...,m
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter_ would it?,m
At the end of the bar.,m
Who said that?,m
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown_ where he's home and dry_ 'cause nobody sees nothing_ nobody says nothing...,m
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...,m
Why'd I do what?,m
Why did you do it?,m
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your_ Warren Hubley.,m
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen_ we just need a minute of your time...,m
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.,m
Did you talk to him?,m
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.,m
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?,m
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left_ he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.,m
Did you learn anything?,m
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.,m
Why the hell--?!  Great_ fine.  You talk to the wife.,m
I believe I should interview the widow alone.,m
"So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that ""possible"" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay_ next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.",m
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.,m
How the hell do you know that?,m
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.,m
And still it fits?,m
Well... Yeah_ it's rubber.  It stretches.,m
And that fits?,m
Get the picture?,m
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men_ human men_ put them on their_ uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?,m
What is this?,m
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?,m
Nothing?,m
Nothing.,m
What's this?  What's going on?,m
Great.  Well_ I'm sure glad that's settled_ aren't you?,m
Yes... no_ it is not unreasonable. Although I--,m
Possibly.  Good.  Well_ would you be willing to accept the theory_ George_ that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?,m
Well... yes_ quite possibly.,m
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related_ right?,m
What is wrong?,m
Well_ there's a thing about partners_ about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you_ that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well_ my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner_ I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.,m
Yes.,m
Look_ you want to fit in here_ right?  You want to learn how to get along?,m
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--,m
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands_ George...,m
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.,m
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?,m
Nice signal_ dickwad!,m
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.,m
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.,m
His body was discovered three days ago_ in an alley off of Central Avenue_ near downtown.,m
Let's talk Hubley.,m
"That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like ""ss'ai k'ss""_ two words in my language which mean ""excrement"" and ""cranium"".",m
Anyway_ what's it matter to you if we think it's funny_ right?  Whatta you care?,m
Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George_ do you?,m
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.,m
Man_ somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart_ Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while_ coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line_ were you_ George?,m
I am George.,m
What's that?  Look_ Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals_ we're not married_ and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.,m
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.,m
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving_ you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.,m
No... two.,m
Yeah_ the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell_ Matt_ you don't need but one.,?
Only holds five.,m
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.,?
What is it?,m
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well_ this is it.,?
... They took the stuff out_ all of it -- this afternoon.,?
Don't piss him off_ O'Neal.  When he gets like this_ I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.,m
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.,?
That where Anderson worked?,m
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.,m
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.,?
Who else can I ask around here?,m
To be honest_ it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.,?
We think he could'a been involved_ yeah.  You know him?,m
You think this is the guy who did it?,?
Well_ one of the men didn't like him so much...,m
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.,?
Sure.  Just a minute.,?
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?,m
I'm sorry_ Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...,?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.,m
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto_ then Coalinga_ California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child_ a son.,?
For you_ anything.,?
Try Joshua Strader_ will ya_ darlin'?,m
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth_ relocated first to Riverside_ then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.,?
That's all I know.  You want anything more_ you ask somebody else.,?
Yeah_ I heard of it.,m
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.,?
One of the two men was Hubley_ right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?,m
What's that?,m
Ss'kya'ta'.,?
Jesus_ are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?,m
Did he find anything?,m
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.,?
What kind of test?,m
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.,?
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?,m
Yeah_ I'll bet.,m
Oh_ here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.,?
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.,?
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.,m
Lucky for you_ you got him in both of his... well_ what we loosely refer to as... hearts.,?
Yeah.,m
You took this gut out_ too_ didn't you?,?
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.,m
No I.D. on him and -- well_ you know_ no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.,?
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male_ twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction_ a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah_ and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.,?
The human?,m
Yeah_ right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway_ according to the sheet_ the guy you nailed outside by the car--,?
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do_ cushy county job like yours.,m
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...,?
Don't tell me what to think.,?
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes_ and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...,m
Granger and Pitts are already on it.,?
You?,?
Departmental policy.,m
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.,?
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.,m
Yeah_ Sykes?,?
I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!,m
I can't!  Do you mind!,?
Get outta there!,m
I got him.  Don't get pinned.,m
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.,?
Yeah_ that's comforting.  Mine_ too.,m
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.,?
You got your vest?,m
Whatever gave you that idea?,?
Does that look at all suspicious to you?,m
Shit_ if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it_ we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.,m
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.,?
Goddammit_ Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married_ okay?  But--,m
Hey_ look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard_ me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...,?
What?,m
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie_ have your landlady tie your shoes for you_ and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.,?
How can I go?,m
It is. ,?
Hope their plumbing's the same.,m
Uh_ seems to be in front and behind.,?
Talk to me_ Hudson.,?
Can't lock up...,?
Position?,?
Movement!,?
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.,?
Hey_ 'Top.'  What's the op?,?
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!,?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.,?
Would you_ Sir?,?
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers_ Hudson?,?
This floor's freezing.,?
Say again?  All after incinerators?,?
Uh_...Apone_ I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC_ over.,?
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.,?
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.,?
Vasquez_ take point.  Let's move.,?
First squad up_ on line.  Hicks_ get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.,?
Ten seconds_ people.  Look sharp!,?
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear_' then stay on station.,?
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.,?
Okay_ let's do it.,?
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.,?
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.,?
Well_ thanks_ I --,m
You did okay_ Bishop.,f
In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.,m
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.,f
Ripley...,m
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!,f
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!,m
HOW MUCH TIME?,f
See you soon.,m
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.,f
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?,f
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me_ I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.,m
What?,f
I'll go.,m
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable_ at this point.,m
And it's too late to shut it down?,f
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.,m
How long until it blows?,f
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.,m
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists_ of course.,m
Could it be intelligent?,f
Well_ the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers_ defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives_ quite literally the  mother of their society.,m
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?,f
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony_ for example_ is ruled by a single female_ a queen_ which is the source of new eggs.,m
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.,f
Yes.  That follows.,m
Which would mean lots of those parasites_ right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.,f
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists_ carried them over there_ cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...,f
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.,m
Sorry to disappoint you.,f
I expected more of you_ Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.,m
Look_ maybe the thing didn't even exist_ right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation_ the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights_ nothing.,m
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them_ Burke. Why didn't you warn them?,f
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke_ Carter J.,f
Now_ wait a second --,m
But they will know about it_ Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --,f
You've been doing your homework. Look_ they can't impound it if they don't know about it.,m
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.,f
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now_ if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.,m
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?,f
Corporal Hicks!?,m
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.,f
Don't make me pull rank_ Ripley.,m
You son of a bitch.,f
Bullshit!,f
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --,m
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?,f
Well_ I mean...I know this is an emotional moment_ but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First_ this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --,m
Why not?,f
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.,m
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.,f
She's right.,m
That's not what I mean.  Gorman_ if your men have to use their weapons in there_ they'll rupture the cooling system.,f
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat_ that's why they built...,m
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.,f
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so_ all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them_ by the way.,m
That the atmosphere processor?,f
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.,m
I hope you're right.  I really do.,f
Well_ it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.,m
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?,f
That's the plan.  My word on it.,m
Burke_ just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.,f
Yello?  Oh_ Ripley.  Hi...,m
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go_ would you.,f
Yes_ and I've read it.  You wake up every night_ sheets soaking_ the same nightmare over and over...,m
Spare me_ Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.,f
If you go.  It's a second chance_ kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...,m
If I go.,f
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?,m
It's all I could get.  Anyway_ it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.,f
Running loaders_ forklifts_ that sort of thing?,m
That's right.,f
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.,m
Yeah_ yeah.  I saw the commercial.,f
Well_ the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration_ against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.',m
What about you?  What's your interest in this?,f
I was reamed_ steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.,f
Hear me out...,m
No.  There's no way!,f
You are a head case.  Have a donut.,m
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.,f
You had them eating out of your hand_ kiddo.,m
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.,m
I get the picture.,f
Look_ I believe you_ but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds_ you got interstellar commerce commission_ you got colonial administration_ insurance company guys...,m
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.,f
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository_ Little Chute_ Wisconsin.  No children.,m
Amy.,f
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name_ I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.,m
Is she...?,f
Well_ I was going to wait until after the inquest...,m
Have they located my daughter yet?,f
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?,m
Fifty-seven...oh_ Christ...,f
Shit.  Apone_ collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.,?
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.,m
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.,?
What's he scanning for?,m
It's insured.,m
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.,?
Dead on all channels.,?
Still nothing from the colony?,m
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.,?
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres_ and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right_ Lieutenant?,m
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.,?
Look_ we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not_ I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.,m
Forget it.,f
All right_ I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look_ Ripley... I...,?
How do you feel?,f
They're but off!  Do something!,f
I told them to fall back...,?
Shut up.  Just shut up!,?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!,f
So?  So?,?
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.,f
So.,?
Proceed inside.,?
I don't know.,f
What is it?,?
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.,f
Where are your parents?  You have to try...,?
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?,?
One of us?,f
The structure seems intact.  They have power.,f
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.,?
Thirty-eight...simulated.,?
How may drops is this for you_ Lieutenant?,f
You tell me.  I only work here.,?
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?,?
Unknown.  But_ it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.,?
Alive?,?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.,?
Okay_ stand by in operations.  Let's go.,?
Sir_ the CPU is on-line.,?
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.,?
...We're coming in.,?
All right_ the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson_ see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks_ meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...,?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?,?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?,?
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.,?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight_ Sir_ on another bug-hunt?,?
What's the question?,?
Hudson_ Sir.  He's Hicks.,?
Yes_ Hicks?,?
Sir?,?
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...,?
Fuckin' A!,m
Let's go!  Let's go!,?
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --,?
Well you're not reading it right!,m
Let's get these things lit.,m
Seventeen meters.,?
Do it!,?
The corner!  Ready?,m
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.,m
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.,?
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?,?
We got problems.,m
Aye-firmative.,?
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right_ let's move like we got a purpose.,m
Are you finished?  You okay?,m
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great_ man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do_ man? We're in some real pretty shit now!,?
Not that tunnel_ the other one!,m
Let's get the fuck out of here!,?
Sure_ Hicks.,?
Save it.,m
Don't be long_ Ellen.,m
Ellen.,f
We ain't going anywhere.,m
Hicks_ don't let him leave.,f
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!,m
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --,f
Stand back.,m
Locked.,f
We didn't miss anything.,m
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in_ something we missed.,f
Get back here_ both of you.  Fall back to Operations.,f
It's game time.,m
Let's waste him.  No offense.,m
You know_ Burke_ I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.,f
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.,f
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.,m
Yeah.  I've noticed.,m
Look_ you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.,f
Well_ that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.,m
What's this?,f
If it comes to that_ I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here_ I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.,m
Hicks_ I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you_ it if comes to that?,f
Maybe.  Maybe not.,m
They'll get us.,f
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.,f
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.,m
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.,m
Now many?,f
On my way.,f
They're in the approach corridor.,m
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units_ here.,f
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.,m
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.,f
About seventeen days.,m
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?,f
Poor bastard.,m
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk_ John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.,f
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.,?
You're just reading me.,?
It's inside the complex.,?
Hudson_ give us a break.,?
Oh_ man.  And I was gettin' short_ too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair_ man!,?
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events_ but we just got out asses kicked_ pal!,?
Yeah_ bullshit.  Watch us.,?
Look_ man_ let's just bug out and call it even_ okay?,?
All right_ we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?,?
Anytime.  Anywhere.,?
Fuck you.,?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.,?
No.  Have you?,?
Hey_ Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?,?
It's readin' right.  Look!,?
Can't be.  That's inside the room!,f
Nine meters.  Eight.,?
They're right on us.  Vasquez_ how you doing?,f
Twelve meters.  Man_ this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.,?
I don't know_ an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors_ not on the plans. I don't know!,f
Fifteen meters.,?
Seal the door.,f
Range twenty meters.,?
Just get back here!,f
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...,?
What do you mean_ they cut the power?  How could they cut the power_ man?  They're animals.,?
They cut the power.,f
Oh_ right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.,?
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.,f
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?,f
Think of what?  We're fucked.,?
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.,f
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.,?
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote_ somehow.,f
Uh_ what's next?,?
Thanks.,f
Yeah_ right_ it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.,?
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.,f
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.,f
Man_ we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here_ just like they did before_ man... they're going to come in here and get us_ man_ long before...,?
Oh_ God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.,?
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.,f
Hey...hey!  Look_ Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead_ man.,?
Looks like it stung him.,f
The embryo_ the second form_ hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --,f
Sounds like you_ Hicks.,?
Tell him_ as far as I'm concerned_ he finds something it's his.,?
So what do I tell this guy?,?
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere_ we look.  They don't say why_ and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.',?
There's a guy on the horn_ mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.,?
Yeah.  What?,?
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau_ out past the Ilium range_ a couple days ago?,?
No.. I've slept enough.,f
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?,?
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?,?
How long have I been on Gateway station?,f
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.,?
Terrible.,f
And how are we today?,?
Yes_ honey.  I think we both can.,f
Can we dream?,f
That's right.,f
Are we going to sleep now?,f
Right here_ baby.  Right here.,f
Mommy...Mommy?,f
Newt_ I want you to hang on_ now.  Hang on tight.,f
I knew you'd come.,f
Newt_ wait!,f
This way.  Come on_ we're almost there!,f
Sure.  Go left.,f
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?,f
Come on.  Crawl faster.,f
Look!,f
Burke!  Open the door!,f
I know_ honey.  Me too.,f
Mommy...I mean_ Ripley...I'm scared.,f
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.,f
Wah...?  Where are...?,f
Newt.  Newt_ wake up.,f
I'll be right in the other room_ Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.,f
Don't go!  Please.,f
You mean dead.,f
Gone.,f
Where is she?,f
Yes.  A little girl.,f
Did you ever have a baby?,f
No_ it's different_ honey.,f
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?,f
I don't know_ Newt.  That's the truth.,f
Did one of those things grow inside her?,f
Well_ some kids can't handle it like you can.,f
Why do they tell little kids that?,f
Yes_ there are_ aren't there.,f
My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.,f
Oh.  Sorry_ Newt.,f
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.,f
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.,f
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.,f
You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.,f
I'm sorry_ Newt.,f
I guess we're not leaving_ right?,f
You're really something_ ace.,f
Yeah_ you know.  In the walls_ under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.,f
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?,f
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.,f
And hope to die?,f
Cross my heart.,f
You promise?,f
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.,f
They're dead.,f
They'd be here if they could_ honey.  I know they would.,f
Because you'll be gone soon_ like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.,f
Why not?,f
I don't want you for a friend.,f
What about me?,f
Casey.  She's my only friend.,f
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.,f
What did you say?,f
Sweet Jesus.,f
Sixty_ maybe seventy families.,?
How many colonists?,f
What are you talking about. What people?,f
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way_ they call it Acheron now.,?
Why won't you check out LV-426?,f
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew_ within twelve hours of hatching...,f
Thank you_ Officer Ripley.  That will be...,?
Look_ I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it_ using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...,f
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.,f
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...,?
It did not_ however_ contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.,?
Look_ I told you...,f
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own_ And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own_ And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!,?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing_ billing_ lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.,?
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid_ Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid_ Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!,?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing_ billing_ lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.,?
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!,?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing_ billing_ lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!,?
What do you mean?,m
His Grace is very angry with you.,?
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.,m
Indeed.,?
Well_ I think that went off remarkably well_ don't you?,m
Certainly!,m
Follow me_ please. The Archbishop would like a word.,?
Meaning you didn't like it.,f
Extremely clever.,m
What did you think of the music?,f
You were sublime.,m
How was I? Tell me honestly.,f
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.,f
Well_ what does it matter to you?,m
The marriage!,f
What?,m
Did you know? Had you heard?,f
Looks don't concern me_ Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.,f
Looks and talent don't always go together_ Katherina.,m
Why?,f
You might be disappointed.,m
What does he look like?,f
Perhaps.,m
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.,f
My dear_ it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.,m
Turkish? Oh_ if it's Turkish_ that's different. I want to be in it.,f
A Turkish brothel.,m
Oh!,f
A brothel.,m
What's that?,f
In a harem.,m
Where?,f
Well_ do you know where it's set_ my dear?,m
Why not?,f
Well even if there is_ I don't think you want to get involved with this one.,m
How do you know?,f
No.,m
Is there a part for me?,f
Yes.,m
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?,f
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.,m
Well_ I heard you met Herr Mozart.,f
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.,m
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!,f
Good morning.,m
Maestro.,f
Excuse us_ Fraulein. Good night_ Signore.,m
No_ no_ no_ no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us_ Wolfgang?,f
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.,f
What??,m
Is she a good fuck?,f
I'm so relieved.,f
No_ she's fine.,m
Is her mother still lying on the floor?,f
Oh - excuse me!,m
I'll be right back.,m
Don't bother.,f
What?,m
Don't bother!,f
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.,m
Oh_ Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!,m
You have leave to try.,?
Oh_ sir_ he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please_ Your Grace_ give him one more chance.,m
And how will you make him keep it?,?
Yes_ sir_ that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again_ I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.,m
Your son is an unprincipled_ spoiled_ conceited brat.,?
Sir -,m
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.,?
Oh sir_ yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.,m
Hardly.,?
But he needs to be here in Salzburg_ Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection_ your understanding.,m
No! I won't have him back.,?
Then try harder_ Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.,?
No_ Your Grace! I mean with all humility_ no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.,m
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.,?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me_ he can dismiss me.,m
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you_ the more you take.,?
Humiliated?,m
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?,?
Why what_ sir?,m
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.,?
In the pot_ I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew_ but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!,m
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!,?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.,m
I've come to dinnnnnner!,?
Who the devil are you? What do you want?,m
Don Giovannnnnnnni!,?
What are you talking about?,?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.,f
Why?,?
Yes!,f
Now?,?
I want to go back to Vienna.,f
Where?,?
I want to go!,f
What is it?,?
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here_ so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please_ please!,f
Go back to bed.,m
It's killing me.,m
Why not?,f
I can't write it!,m
Give me one reason I can understand.,f
Give me two more weeks. Please.,m
Oh yes_ sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.,f
This is my wife_ Stanzi. I've been sick_ but I'm all right now. Aren't I?,m
Why?,f
No. Don't answer it!,m
You'd think I was mad.,m
Why not?,f
I'm not telling you.,m
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi_ who gave you this?,f
I heard voices.,f
No one.,m
Who was that?,f
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.,f
Stanzi-manzi_ I'll put it in your hand!,m
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here_ in my hand.,f
Well_ you liked it_ didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.,m
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.,f
Oh_ Stanzi.,m
When? We need money now. Either he pays now_ or you don't do it.,f
Why not? Half the house!,m
You're not going to do this?,f
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?,f
Half the receipts! Stanzi!,m
Your father is dead.,f
What?,m
Wolfi! Your father is dead.,f
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop_ you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over_ finished_ done with! Done with! Done with!,m
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.,f
Yes_ my love?,m
Wolfi.,f
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.,m
No_ it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you_ can we?,f
Stanzi!,m
Look_ old man_ you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you_ more than we can possibly afford_ and all you do is criticize_ morning to night. And then you think you can -,f
Oh_ damn!,m
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.,f
Well_ ask her!,m
I don't know.,f
What does she want?,m
There's a young girl to see you.,f
Wolfi_ I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.,f
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!,m
Wolfi!,f
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea_ Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties_ don't you?,m
May I offer you some tea_ Herr Mozart?,f
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.,m
Stop it_ Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house_ Herr Mozart.,f
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now_ confess_ Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?,m
I love you! I love you!,f
Yes!,m
No!,f
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.,m
Tell them to go!,f
What's the matter with you?,m
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.,f
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.,m
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!,f
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.,m
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?,f
Don't be stupid.,m
How are we going to live_ Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?,f
Well_ don't do that again!,m
Yes!,f
You borrowed money from your mother?,m
Well_ I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother_ and that's that!,f
Oh yes? You always know everything.,m
No_ they will not. I know how things work in this city.,f
They'll come anyway. They love me here.,m
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!,f
Oh_ leave me alone.,m
I think you're mad! You're really mad!,f
Of course.,m
Excuse me_ Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?,f
Eat my - ah!,f
Yes.,m
Eat,f
Tish-I'm-tee.,m
What?,f
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?,m
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!,f
Ui-vol-i-tub!,m
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No_ no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.,f
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!,m
No!,f
No_ this is serious. Say it backwards.,m
No_ I'm not playing this game.,f
Em iram! Em iram!,m
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!,f
No_ no. Say it backwards_ shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!,m
Yes_ you are. You're very sick.,f
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!,m
Oh_ ha_ ha_ ha.,f
Yes_ I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.,m
Do you think that's funny?,f
Why? People fart backwards.,m
That's stupid.,f
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards_ dance backwards_ sing backwards_ and talk backwards.,m
Why not?,f
Go ahead_ tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.,m
Your Grace_ I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.,f
Fartsbishop!,f
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.,m
Where?,f
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?,m
No! No! No!,f
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look_ I've stopped. Now we are going back.,m
Stop it!,f
Madame_ I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.,m
I regret we have no servants to show you out_ Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.,f
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.,f
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.,m
This is not his handwriting.,f
And I'm asking you -,f
He asked me to stay.,m
No_ he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go_ please.,f
He needs me_ ma'am.,m
Well_ thank you very much. You can go now.,f
I was at hand.,m
Why you?,f
Your husband is ill_ ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.,m
What are you doing here?,f
Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.,f
What?,m
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?,f
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague_ that is the price.,m
But! I'm a married woman!,f
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband_ come tonight.,m
Isn't it obvious?,m
What do you mean?,f
Some service deserves service in return. No?,m
What for?,f
Alone.,m
Tonight?,f
Come back tonight.,m
Oh_ thank you_ sir!,f
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.,m
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.,f
It is miraculous.,m
Yes_ sir. He doesn't make copies.,f
These are originals?,m
Yes.,f
Originals?,m
That's very tempting_ but it's impossible_ I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see_ they're all originals.,f
Are you sure you can't leave that music_ and come back again? I have other things you might like.,m
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer_ you know. I'm from a small town_ just like your husband.,m
Thank you very much_ Your Excellency.,f
Sir_ we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers_ it's really ridiculous_ Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!,f
I see.,m
No_ sir. This is my own idea.,f
Then he didn't send you?,m
My husband is a proud man_ sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.,f
Really?,m
I - I really cannot do that_ Your Excellency. You see_ he doesn't know I'm here.,f
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.,m
Would it be too much trouble_ sir_ to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.,f
I will look at them_ of course_ the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.,m
I understand.,m
He's terribly busy_ sir.,f
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?,m
That's right_ Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.,f
Frau Mozart?,m
Madame. How can I help you?,m
Excellency!,f
Oh yes_ and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?,f
You're mad! She's mad_ Wolfi.,m
Money! Money!,f
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?,m
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto_ that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!,f
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!,m
He's doing his best.,f
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?,m
Leave him alone!,f
Look_ you little clown_ do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?,m
I hope so. I need it immediately.,m
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.,f
Where's our friend?,m
Not at all.,f
Am I interrupting something?,m
Ah. Well. Ah_  I see you've got your manager with you. Well_ Madame_ how about half the receipts?,m
How much will you pay him?,f
Do you hear him? Do you?,f
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.,m
Oh_ now I'm a bad housekeeper!,f
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?,m
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.,f
Well_ this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay_ no?,f
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!,m
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.,f
In three months! Papa.,f
When_ may I ask?,m
Oh_ yes.,f
I see that you're expecting.,m
Behold!,?
Behold!,?
Hey!,?
Hey!,?
Behold!,?
Behold!,?
Adorable!,?
He's adorable!,?
Be careful!,?
Be careful!,?
Young man_ I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!,?
I am sorry_ Madame_ but no! I cannot let anyone pass.,?
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!,?
I am sorry_ Madame_ but I have my orders.,?
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!,?
I am sorry_ Madame. It is not permitted.,?
Let us pass_ please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.,?
Yes. He is a little strange.,?
What a strange young man.,?
Michael!,?
I said play!,?
Michael_ please! I'm sure you will find her most willing_ Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.,?
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks_ say so.,?
It's such an honour for us to have you here_ Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.,?
Gertrude!,?
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.,?
You can't be Herr Mozart!,?
Gertrude!,?
Upstairs.,?
Thank you_ Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.,m
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.,?
Who was your teacher?,m
Just one year.,?
Wine?,?
I'd like a little wine_ if you have it.,m
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee_ or a little chocolate?,?
Ah_ now! Here she comes.,?
Really?,m
Well_ look at them.,m
It is not a question of liking_ Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it_ I'm afraid.,m
Do you like this_ Salieri?,m
Molested_ Majesty. Twice_ in the course of the same lesson.,m
Yes?,m
As a matter of fact_ one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!,m
Really?,m
I have to tell you_ Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.,m
Of course not.,m
Majesty_ I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.,m
Oh?,m
Well_ Sire_ I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.,m
Why not?,m
Majesty_ I did. Believe me_ it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally_ I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.,m
I don't think you understand me_ Court Composer.,m
Well. There it is.,m
Sire.,m
You please me_ Court Composer. A very clever idea.,m
I'm sure there is a way_ Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee_ and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.,m
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.,m
Yes_ of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.,m
And the result satisfies.,m
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.,m
Yes?,m
An interesting idea_ Majesty. But -,m
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?,m
Oh_ Your Majesty_ it would be such a tremendous honour!,m
Your Highness.,m
Good morning_ Court Composer. This is my niece_ the Princess Elizabeth.,m
Cattivo again_ Court Composer. Well_ tell him_ Mozart. Name us a German virtue.,m
Excuse me_ Sire_ but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner_ I would love to learn.,m
Well_ I'm glad to hear that.,m
Well_ there it is. Now to business. Young man_ we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?,m
My pleasure.,m
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!,m
And here is our illustrious Court Composer_ Herr Salieri.,m
Ah-ha!,m
A-flat_ Majesty.,m
Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart_ please. But slowly_ slowly. I need a minute to practice.,m
You do me too much honour_ Sire.,m
Delightful_ Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?,m
Majesty.,m
May I try it?,m
It's just a trifle_ of course.,m
What a charming idea. May I see?,m
You are cattivo_ Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain_ arrange a pleasant welcome for him.,m
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna_ Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.,m
Sire_ the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?,m
You are passionate_ Mozart! But you do not persuade.,m
Forgive me_ Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you_ my music is not.,m
Twenty_ sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.,m
Well_ six or seven minutes! maybe eight!,m
Guess! Guess_ Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last_ then double it.,m
I have no idea.,m
But it's new_ it's entirely new. It's so new_ people will go mad for it. For example_ I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet_ just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet_ and so on.  On and on_ sextet_ septet_ octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?,m
Ah_ love again.,m
But_ Majesty_ this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.,m
I think you are rather innocent_ my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.,m
Sire_ I swear to Your Majesty_ there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.,m
Mozart_ I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do_ I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.,m
Well_ Majesty_ it is only a comedy.,m
Would you tell me why?,m
Well_ yes_ I admit it is.,m
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?,m
Who told you this_ Majesty?,m
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?,m
Yes_ Sire.,m
Mozart_ are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?,m
Ah! By all means.,m
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.,m
What is it?,m
Majesty_ may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?,m
Thank you_ Sire!,m
Bravo_ Mozart. Most charming. Yes_ indeed. Clever man.,m
Well_ my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.,m
Twenty-six.,m
Excuse me_ but how old are you?,m
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent_ Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.,m
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?,m
Enchanted_ Madame.,m
Majesty_ this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.,m
Which few did you have in mind_ Majesty?,m
My dear_ young man_ don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes_ that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.,m
My dear fellow_ there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that_ aren't I_ Court Composer?,m
I don't understand. There are just as many notes_ Majesty_ as are required. Neither more nor less.,m
Well_ I mean occasionally it seems to have_ how shall one say?  How shall one say_ Director?,m
What do you mean_ Sire?,m
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.,m
So then you like it? You really like it_ Your Majesty?,m
Oh_ yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!,m
And German?,m
Yes_ indeed.,m
It is new_ it is_ isn't it_ Sire?,m
I think so_ Sire_ yes.,m
What? On one hearing only?,m
Keep it_ Sire_ if you want to. It is already here in my head.,m
Ah-ha.,m
In a Pasha's Harem_ Majesty. A Seraglio.,m
Yes_ where?,m
It's actually quite amusing_ Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -,m
Well_ what is it about? Tell us the story.,m
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!,m
Why so?,m
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?,m
Majesty!,m
Really? Oh_ grazie_ Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!,m
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.,m
Oh sir_ yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.,m
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.,m
Oh_ thank you.,m
No_ no_ please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it_ you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool_ he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself_ and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said_ Will you marry me_ yes or no?,m
Your Majesty!,m
Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.,m
He's here.,?
Yes_ what about him?,m
Your Majesty_ Herr Mozart -,?
Well_ what do you have for me today?,m
Well. There it is.,m
Yes_ sir.,?
In my opinion_ it is time we had a piece in our own language_ sir. Plain German. For plain people.,?
Ah-ha. What do you say_ Chamberlain?,m
Very small pay_ I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say_ an opera in German for our National Theatre.,m
I agree_ Majesty_ but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.,?
Ah-ha. Well then_ we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna_ surely?,m
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty_ I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all_ could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother_ that your days may be long upon the earth.',m
Father -,m
She does. She says I sleep all day.,m
No one calls you that.,m
Don't worry_ I'm not staying here to be a burden.,m
Papa!,m
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!,m
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?,m
Are you playing a trick on me?,m
Mine?,m
Papa_ is this your idea?,m
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.,m
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.,m
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg_ my son.,m
Yes_ Papa_ name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!,m
This is just a game_ Papa.,m
No_ really!,m
Why not? Oh_ come_ Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable_ missable_ suddenly visible Papa!,m
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.,m
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.,m
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?,m
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.,m
It's too dangerous_ Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah_ there she is!,m
You don't have secrets from me.,m
It's a secret.,m
Why not?,m
Oh_ let's not talk about it.,m
What's that?,m
This one will.,m
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.,m
I don't know. It's not important. I mean_ I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.,m
How many?,m
Yes.,m
Yes.,m
Pupils?,m
How many pupils do you have?,m
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!,m
They say you're in debt.,m
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really_ it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.,m
That's not what I hear.,m
It couldn't be better.,m
How is your financial situation?,m
Oh we could_ if we wanted to_ but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.,m
Don't you have a maid?,m
She's very tired_ poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.,m
Oh_ yes. Oh_ I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today_ Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes_ she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman_ you'll see.,m
Do you always live like this?,m
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!,m
Is she not here?,m
Feed? Well_ of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean_ since Mama. Just wait_ you'll see.,m
Of course_ welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!,m
Am I not welcome?,m
Why are you here?,m
I will.,m
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours_ do as I bid_ and await my coming.,m
Are you sure it's an opera?,m
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very_ very frightened.,f
Opera? Opera!,m
I suppose so. He sits there all he time_ doing some silly opera.,f
Is he working?,m
I'm frightened_ sir. Really! When he speaks_ he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.,f
Is he working?,m
Here_ in his stomach. They bend him right over.,f
Where?,m
I don't know. He has pains.,f
What medicine?,m
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day_ then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.,f
Why? What has happened?,m
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!,f
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?,m
In there_ sir.,f
Where does he work?,m
Yes what?,m
I think I've found out about the money_ sir.,f
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house_ let me know_ will you?,m
Oh_ I wouldn't know that_ sir.,f
Really? What is it he's writing?,m
Oh_ yes_ sir_ all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there_ writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.,f
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?,m
Not that I've seen.,f
Do any pupils come to the house?,m
Oh_ thank you_ sir.,f
Bene.,m
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson_ sir.,f
Bene! Bene!,m
Yes_ thank you_ sir.,f
Thank you. Are you well today_ Fraulein Lorl?,m
I will_ sir.,f
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.,m
What have you got for me today? Let me see.,m
Good morning_ sir.,f
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl_ good morning.,m
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.,f
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?,m
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.,f
What?,m
My name is Lorl_ sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.,f
That's right.,m
Are you Herr Mozart?,f
Yes?,m
So let me see it. Where is it?,m
Well_ we can.,m
Look_ I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.,m
Because there's nothing to see.,m
Why not?,m
No.,m
Can I see it?,m
Yes.,m
What? The vaudeville_ what'd you think?,m
What?,m
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?,m
Put it down_ I said! It's nothing for you.,m
What is this?,m
Put it down!,m
Wolfi!,m
Leave that alone!,m
So there you are. What do you say?,m
No_ no_ I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.,m
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?,m
German!,m
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs_ I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you_ it'll have to be in German.,m
I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches_ just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.,m
Animals?,m
'Course you would. You belong here_ my boy_ not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want_ you know: fantasy. You do a big production_ fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course_ you'd have to put a fire in it_ because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh_ and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.,m
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.,m
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle_ that horse_ but he's worth it. I tell you_ if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.,m
I liked the horse.,m
Yes_ well_ it's all good fun.,m
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey_ didn't you?,m
That kind of music should be punishable by death.,m
Sublime! Utterly sublime!,m
Well?,m
Papa_ the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.,m
What did he say? What did he say?,m
Sssh! Stay here.,m
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!,m
Sssh!,m
My answer is no_ Mozart.,?
Please. I'll give it back_ I promise. Please_ sir.,m
I'm sorry. No.,?
No doubt_ sir. But I am endowed with talent_ and you with money. If I offer mine_ you should offer yours.,m
Well_ this is hardly the way to go about it.,?
If a man cannot earn_ he must borrow.,m
What for?,?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services_ could you favour me with a little money instead?,m
What is this_ Mozart? What's the matter with you?,?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?,m
Well_ your pupil is married and living in Mannheim_ young man.,?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?,m
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?,?
Well_ I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs_ please let me know. Goodbye_ Fraulein_ goodbye_ Madame! goodbye_ Sir!,m
It's a miracle_ Herr Mozart!,?
Well_ yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing_ Fraulein?,m
Never mind_ Strudel. It's part of music_ getting used to an audience. Aren't I right_ Herr Mozart?,?
Strudel_ this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.,?
Good morning_ Fraulein Schlumberg.,m
Of course_ it's him. Who do you think it is?,?
I'm afraid I am.,m
This is Herr Mozart_ my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?,?
Madame.,m
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.,?
What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one_ eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.,?
And which one of them do you want me to teach?,m
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there_ damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention_ they're impossible. Stop it_ you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless_ just willful. I treat them just like my own children.,?
I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!,m
What for?,m
I am so ashamed.,m
I'm not leaving you.,m
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?,m
I can keep going_ I assure you. Shall we try?,m
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.,m
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.,m
Do you want to rest a bit?,m
Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!,m
Yes.,m
Do you have it?,m
You go fast!,m
And that's it. Do you have it?,m
Yes!,m
Yes_ and on 'dictis'.,m
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?,m
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca_ vo-ca me_ vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.,m
Yes_ yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce_ pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.,m
That's wonderful!,m
Show me.,m
I think so.,m
Do you have me?,m
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.,m
And that's all?,m
Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani_ tonic and dominant.,m
Also identical?,m
With the tenors.,m
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?,m
It couldn't be simpler.,m
Please! Just one moment.,m
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -,m
Fourth measure_ second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis_ flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.,m
Yes.,m
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure_ fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?,m
Sing it back.,m
I think so.,m
Third measure_ second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure_ fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis_ flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?,m
Yes.,m
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure_ second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp_ of course.,m
Common time.,m
What time?,m
The Fire.,m
So now - A minor. Suddenly.,m
Yes.,m
We ended in F Major?,m
Confutatis Maledictis.,m
Come. Let's begin.,m
Strange!,m
Oh_ yes.,m
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?,m
What?,m
Do you believe in it?,m
Consigned to flames of woe.,m
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?,m
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.,m
Where did I stop?,m
A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.,m
Then_ let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me_ what is this work?,m
You know_ it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.,m
Of course.,m
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.,m
My dear friend_ it would be my greatest pleasure.,m
Would you? Actually_ you could.,m
Yes. Can I - could I help you_ in any way?,m
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?,m
He knows. He knows!,m
Finish what?,m
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would_ that would help me finish it.,m
What man?,m
The man. He's here.,m
Who?,m
No! No_ it's him!,m
Shall I answer it?,m
I'm too young to be so sick.,m
What?,m
The doctor thinks I am. But -,m
Are you ill?,m
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much_ and think stupid things.,m
I do.,m
Do you mean that?,m
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you_ you are the greatest composer known to me.,m
This is only a vaudeville.,m
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.,m
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.,m
No_ please.,m
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.,m
You mean she's not coming back?,m
Not here! She's not well_ either. She went to the Spa.,m
Where is your wife?,m
No_ no. I have to get back. I have -,m
I'm taking you home. You're not well.,m
What happened? Is it over?,m
No_ no! I promise you_ I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!,m
Are you neglecting my request?,m
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry_ but I need more time.,m
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.,m
How long will you give me?,m
How much?,m
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.,m
Who are you?,m
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.,m
What dead? Who is dead?,m
A Mass for the dead.,m
What work?,m
I have come to commission work from you.,m
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say_ but - Salieri!,m
You flatter me.,m
I never knew that music like that was possible.,m
Yes?,m
How could it not_ Excellency?,m
Did my work please you?,m
How could I not?,m
Mozart. It was good of you to come.,m
Grazie_ a lei_ Signor Antonio!,m
Grazie_ mio caro_ Wolfgang!,m
Oh no_ the honour would be all mine.,m
I wouldn't presume. All the same_ if it wouldn't be imposing_ I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.,m
I know_ I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.,m
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese_ my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?,m
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?,m
I think it's marvelous. Truly.,m
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?,m
Well_ I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.,m
But what is it they don't like?,m
I know; it's outrageous. Still_ if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.,m
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.,m
Thank you! Oh_ thank you.,m
With all my heart_ Mozart.,m
Oh_ Excellency_ would you?,m
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.,m
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.,m
How fortunate.,m
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.,m
You burned the score?,m
Oh_ I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire_ he made me so angry!,m
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.,m
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera_ but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?,m
Really? Why?,m
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.,m
Wolfgang_ what is it? Sta calmo_ per favore. What's the matter?,m
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor_ Mozart. However_ I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?,m
I can't say. Really,m
What exactly are you working on?,m
Two thousand_ two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?,m
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.,m
Ah. Italian?,m
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.,m
Actually_ it's a big secret. Oh_ this is delicious! What is it?,m
Come_ come_ Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.,m
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.,m
Ah_ how exciting! Tell me more.,m
Well_ could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh_ I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously_ is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months_ eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!,m
I'm afraid not.,m
Do you have a daughter?,m
Of course not.,m
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play_ but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!,m
How is that possible? You give concerts_ don't you? I hear they are quite successful.,m
How can anyone say that? We have no cook_ no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!,m
It has been said_ my friend_ that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.,m
No_ but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.,m
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?,m
Look_ I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.,m
An implausible idea. Between you and me_ no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.,m
But I can't lose this post_ I simply can't! Excellency_ please. Let's go to the palace_ and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!,m
No_ no_ no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.,m
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.,m
Herr Sommer.,m
Whom did they choose?,m
My dear Mozart_ there is no one in the world I would rather help_ but now it is too late.,m
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please_ can't you help me? Please!,m
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.,m
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?,m
Why didn't you come to me yesterday_ Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today_ I can't.,m
So you see_ this post is very important to me right now.,m
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you_ of course.,m
She is well. She is - well_ actually_ I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.,m
So you are. How is your pretty wife?,m
Your Excellency_ you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know_ I'm a married man now.,m
Herr Mozart_ what brings you here?,m
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?,m
How could I not?,m
Did you like it_ then?,m
Dear Mozart_ my sincere congratulations.,m
But this is absurd!,m
Yes! yes! er_ on  the whole_ yes_ Majesty.,m
Ah_ love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.,m
Love_ Sire!,m
A funny little tune_ but it yielded some good things.,m
Ah!,m
Mio caro Adone.,m
Really?,m
I know your work well_ Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?,m
Oh yes_ certainly. Certainly_ Herr Director!,m
Can we see the scene with the music back_ please?,?
Taking out what you should never have put in.,?
What are you doing_ Herr Director?,m
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score_ please.,?
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.,m
Exactly. A dance.,?
Yes_ but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.,m
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?,?
Certainly_ Herr Director.,m
Mozart! Herr Mozart_ may I have a word with you please. Right away.,?
Just let me tell you how it begins.,m
That will do_ Herr Mozart!,?
But_ Your Majesty -,m
What you think_ Mozart_ is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.,?
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish_ if you really want. I don't care.,m
Then why especially does it have to be in German?,?
Exactly.,m
You mean in Turkey?,?
I think you'd better.,?
I - I don't think you have_ Herr Director. Not yet. I mean_ it's quite n - Of course_ I'll show it to you immediately.,m
Oh? Have I seen it?,?
May I just do that_ Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?,m
Herr Mozart -,?
Must I? Well_ I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!,m
Look_ young man_ the issue is simple. If you want this post_ you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.,?
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!,m
Mozart -,?
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant_ tonic and dominant_ from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.,m
Mozart -,?
Naturally_ the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!,m
Kapellmeister Bonno_ Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.,?
Who is on this committee?,m
A little modesty would suit you better.,?
No_ but I'm the best.,m
Mozart_ you are not the only composer in Vienna.,?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?,m
On the contrary.,?
Is the Emperor angry with me?,m
Because His Majesty wishes it.,?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.,m
What is what?,?
What is this_ Herr Chamberlain?,m
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us_ not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me_ just as much as His Majesty.,?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh_ excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?,m
Mozart_ music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out_ this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?,?
Sire_ only opera can do this. In a play_ if more than one person speaks at the same time_ it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music_ with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once_ and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?,m
Mozart -,?
Baron!,m
Well done_ Mozart. Really quite fine.,?
Why not? It's charming. I mean_ I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral_ Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!,m
My dear fellow_ the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?,?
Oh_ German! German! Please let it be German.,m
I don't think it was really decided_ Director.,?
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart_ not I. Took him_ snatched him away_ without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him_ and threw him away. Like an old_ worn out flute.,m
Oh my son_ my poor son!,m
No_ Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love_ they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me_ your merciful God!,m
My son_ why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?,m
What difference does that make?,m
But not his body.,m
I poisoned his life.,m
No_ you didn't!,m
I did.,m
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.,m
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it_ with your own hands.,m
Yes.,m
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral_ all Vienna sitting there. His coffin_ Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence_ music. A divine music bursts out over them all_ a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart_ composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God_ forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end_ for once_ laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?,m
What?,m
Oh yes_ yes_ yes_ yes_ yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy_ Father. Just a God of torture.,m
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.,m
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!,m
My son_ no one can speak for God.,m
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing_ isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music_ why implant the desire_ like a lust in my body_ then deny me the talent? Go on_ tell me! Speak for Him!,m
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.,m
No? Was Mozart a good man?,m
You cannot say that!,m
Yes_ Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good_ patient_ hard-working_ chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.,m
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!,m
Did you try?,m
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense_ no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same_ why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.,m
He was murdered_ Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.,m
Do you hear me?,m
Should I?,m
Do you believe it?,m
Is it true?,m
And do they believe it?,m
All Vienna has heard that.,m
Ah - you've heard that?,m
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.,m
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?,m
Oh_ I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.,m
Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?,m
I regret it is not too familiar.,m
Well?,m
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?,m
I can't say I do. What is it?,m
Then you must know this.,m
Here in Vienna.,m
Where?,m
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.,m
How well are you trained in music?,m
My son_ there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.,m
I do not seek forgiveness.,m
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.,m
Are they?,m
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.,m
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me_ did you?,m
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.,m
Leave me alone.,m
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.,m
What do you want?,m
In the sight of God that is a sin.,m
So?,m
You tried to take your life. You do remember that_ don't you?,m
About what?,m
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.,m
What do you want?,m
Yes_ in the third act.,m
Yes_ absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?,?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?,m
Ballet? What ballet?,?
About the ballet.,m
What anger?,?
The Emperor has given him permission.,?
Incredible.,m
Well_ Mozart is already rehearsing.,?
Never mind.,m
Where?,?
I've seen the manuscript.,m
Are you absolutely sure?,?
You must be mad.,?
Yes.,m
He's setting that play to music?,?
Exactly.,m
You mean that play?,?
Italian?,?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.,m
Yes?,?
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you_ Herr Director.,m
Ah.,?
Well_ the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be_ in a grander situation_ as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.,?
Oh yes_ yes. And that was?,?
For the same reason_ Herr Chamberlain_ that it was banned in France.,?
I know we banned this play_ but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory_ Herr Director?,?
Did we?,?
Well_ actually_ Sire_ if you remember_ we did finally incline to Italian.,?
Well done_ Sire!,?
Bravo_ Your Majesty!,?
Oh_ I'm tender enough for you_ my boy. I'm tender enough for you.,?
Well_ I don't know! I mean you're a delicious_ delightful_ delectable little bird_ but don't you think you might be just a little tough?,?
Of course now. Right away_ before I get any older.,?
What do you mean - now?,?
Well_ promise then.,?
I can't wait.,?
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.,?
Oh. Well_ thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.,?
I've taken pity on you_ my angel. I heard your wish.,?
What? Who the devil are you?,?
Here I am_ my angel.,?
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.,m
How sad. It's tragic_ isn't it? Such a talent.,?
No_ Baron_ no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.,m
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?,?
I agree_ Baron.,m
This is embarrassing_ you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.,?
Come with me. And stay in the room.,m
He didn't say_ sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back_ but he insisted on waiting.,?
What does he want?,m
Show her in. Then go to bed.,m
That lady is back_ sir.,?
Excuse me_ my dear.,m
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.,?
Who is she?,m
Excuse me_ sir_ there is a lady who insists on talking to you.,?
Yes_ indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!,m
Oh_ by the way_ give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up_ eh?,m
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.,m
I'll call tomorrow.,m
Bene.,m
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.,m
Of course.,m
Well_ tell him we were here_ won't you?,m
Oh_ yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy_ that's all. We should let him rest.,m
But he's all right?,m
Well_ he's sleeping now. Better not.,m
Can we come in?,m
Yes_ I am looking after him.,m
Herr Salieri.,m
Thank you.,f
I'm an orderly_ not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about_ but I've little say what happens to them.,?
You know_ did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?,f
What do you mean_ 'how did he look'?,?
How did he look?,f
The American? Yes_ duck.,?
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?,f
I doubt it. But it's something to do.,m
David?,f
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.,m
Tea would be nice.,m
What shall we do?,f
I expect you shortly.,m
No_ a cab will be faster.,f
Shall I send a car?,m
He's fine. We'll come right over.,f
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?,m
Yes_ Doctor.,f
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?,m
Yes_ I should think so.,f
Could you get here without any trouble?,m
No_ not really.,f
Is David acting strangely?,m
No_ why?,f
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?,m
Yes_ he is. He's very excited and confused_ but he's not crazy_ if that's what you mean.,f
The zoo? Is he rational?,m
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.,f
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?,m
He's here.,f
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.,m
What shall we do?,f
Oh_ I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself_ or perhaps others.,m
Dr. Hirsch?,f
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf_ why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf_ wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?,m
Surely you're not suggesting...,f
No. He knows no one in London_ besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.,f
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?,m
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that_ like David_ they believe in this werewolf.,m
And what else?,f
They were lying. There were no witnesses_ no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.,m
Yes.,f
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.,m
Dr. Hirsch_ what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?,f
Warn him?,m
David says Jack comes to warn him.,f
What did he say?,m
Yes.,f
Has his friend appeared to him again?,m
Well_ yes_ but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.,f
Alex_ has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?,m
He's not?,f
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...,f
It's a full moon. Where is he?,m
Yes_ sir.,f
Oh dear girl_ your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.,m
Come to my office_ Miss Price.,m
It's all right_ Susan. Yes_ Doctor_ I have.,f
Yes_ I believe he did.,f
Did he say a wolf?,m
No_ sir. Of course_ sir. Good day_ Doctor.,f
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern_ Miss Price.,m
What happened to them?,f
That would be Jack Goodman_ the boy who was killed.,m
He said 'Jack'.,f
What exactly did he call out?,m
Yes_ Doctor?,f
Oh_ Miss Price?,m
Yes_ Doctor.,f
Go about your duties.,m
Dr. Hirsch?,f
Can I be of service_ Miss Price?,m
Miss Gallagher_ surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.,m
Dr. Hirsch_ Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.,f
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!,m
David_ don't lose control.,f
Leave me alone_ dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!,m
David_ let's go now.,f
Hopeless. It's hopeless.,m
Will you shut up!?!!,m
Sir_ he's very upset. His friend was killed and...,f
I swear_ I don't know this girl.,m
We had an argument. He's being silly.,f
What?,m
He's playing a stupid joke_ sir.,f
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf_ for Christ's sake!,m
David_ please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.,f
Jack is dead. Look_ six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.,m
Jack is dead!,f
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...,m
David_ stop!,f
Six people mutilated? It had to be me_ Alex.,m
David_ what are you doing?,f
Pull over.,m
But...,f
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.,m
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.,f
I should be committed.,m
The next corner we can get a cab.,f
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.,m
Don't you remember?,f
Waking up at the zoo_ that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night_ Alex?,m
The zoo?,f
Alex_ I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!,m
I'm freezing.,m
David! Where on earth have you been!?!,f
See you later.,m
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.,f
A doper werewolf.,m
I've left those pills for you.,f
Okay.,m
Listen_ if you get too anxious_ call me at the hospital_ okay?,f
Yeah_ I do_ but go to work.,m
David_ do you want me to stay here tonight?,f
Werewolves simply do not exist.,m
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.,f
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.,m
Anything.,f
Do me an enormous favor?,m
Let me go now_ you'll make me late.,f
That's good_ Alex.  Reassure me.,m
Tomorrow is the full moon.,f
I wasn't hallucinating.,m
But_ David.,f
I was awake and he was in my room.,m
David_ you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?,f
Good.,m
Of course.,f
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?,m
Yes?,f
Alex?,m
It's nice to see you.,f
It's nice to see you.,m
David_ perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.,f
There is only one bed.,m
The bedroom.,f
Lovely.,m
Bathroom.,f
Charming.,m
Closet.,f
Very nice.,m
The kitchen.,f
Yeah_ I would think so_ too.,m
I would think so.,f
I was dreaming again?,m
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?,f
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?,m
Your dead friend Jack?,f
My friend Jack was just here.,m
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?,f
I'll let you know the next full moon.,m
Are you better now?,f
A werewolf?,f
I'm a werewolf.,m
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.,f
Now I'm embarrassed.,m
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?,f
Forgive me_ I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.,m
You're being awfully forward_ aren't you?,f
Not just a patient -- me.,m
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?,f
Will you think about it?,m
Now_ David_ I said I would keep you company_ but I meant right here and now.,f
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.,m
What?,f
Will you come with me?,m
David_ your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.,f
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.,m
That's easy enough.,f
No_ thank you. Just keep me company for a while.,m
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?,f
I'm sorry I woke you up.,m
Hello. You all right?,f
Ahem_ A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity_ his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor_ and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...,f
Yes_ go on.,m
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?,f
What? Oh_ yes_ please.,m
Shall I read to you?,f
My best friend. My very best friend.,m
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?,f
Now what do you want to talk about?,m
I know.,f
I'm twenty-seven.,m
Twenty-eight.,f
How old are you?,m
That's not really a very proper question.,f
How old are you?,m
It's okay. I want to talk to you.,m
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.,f
I dream of death mostly.,m
What do you dream about?,f
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.,f
Do you like it?,m
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.,f
I was. What are you reading?,m
I thought you were asleep.,f
You're a very beautiful girl.,m
Will you give me a break?,m
Let's try a little harder_ shall we?,f
Right.,f
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.,m
Shall I be forced to feed you_ David?,f
Call me David.,m
Shall I be forced to feed you_ Mr. Kessler?,f
Aw come on_ Alex!,m
Call me Alex.,f
Aw come on_ Miss Price!,m
Sorry.,f
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.,m
Well_ you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?,f
How is that?,m
You put me in an awkward position_ Mr. Kessler.,f
Please_ really. I'm not hungry.,m
I'm afraid you have to eat something.,f
I'm not very hungry_ thank you.,m
You haven't eaten your lunch.,f
Yes?,m
Mr. Kessler?,f
A wolf.,m
What?,f
It was a wolf.,m
I beg your pardon?,f
It wasn't a lunatic.,m
I thought not.,f
No.,?
Benjamin_ have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?,f
No!,?
No what?,f
No.,?
How are we feeling tonight?,f
Right.,f
No.,?
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.,f
No.,?
Feeling better?,f
No.,?
Well_ all right then_ be that way. Here_ swallow this.,f
No.,?
No what?,f
No.,?
Hello_ Benjamin.,f
Really_ Susan_ I don't think that was very proper_ and besides_ it's common practice now.,f
I looked.,?
Why on earth do you say that?,f
I think he's a Jew.,?
Chart says he's from New York.,f
He's an American_ you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.,?
Yes_ I should think. He called out just now.,f
He all right?,?
Yes_ Mrs. Hobbs.,f
Nothing quite as dramatic as that_ Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.,?
Has he been refusing food?,f
Take these round now_ will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?,?
Yes_ Mrs. Hobbs.,f
Miss Price.,?
That's what I want you to do_ you moron!,m
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.,?
Who is this girl?,m
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!,m
Now see here young man.,?
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!,m
There's no call for that kind of language.,?
Hey_ you asshole! I want you to arrest me!,m
All right_ you two_ move along.,?
You did_ did you?,?
Officer_ I killed those people last night.,m
Why are you doing this to me?,m
No_ David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.,?
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.,m
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.,?
Mr. Bringsly_ I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.,m
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend_ whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.,?
Why are you doing this to me_ Jack?,m
You could have told them!,?
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!,?
That's very funny_ that is.,?
Oh_ all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.,?
No. You've had your chance.,?
Oh_ come on_ tell us.,?
All right_ laugh then. I shan't tell it.,?
Quiet_ everyone! Hush! Shhh!,?
You be quiet_ woman_ and let me speak.,?
No_ but we're about to.,?
Here_ Gladys_ Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?,?
Bambi?,?
Yes_ but does everyone kill Bambi?,m
Some_ everyone does.,?
Do you have bad dreams_ too?,m
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday'_ and I want to see it badly_ so you give me no problems and go to sleep.,?
What are you going to see?,m
Miss Price_ the other nurse that attended you.,?
Alex?,m
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly_ then I'm off to the films with Alex.,?
What time is it?,m
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.,?
I was having a nightmare.,m
Mr. Kessler? Wake up_ please.,?
Of course not_ David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.,m
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.,m
Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book_ you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud_ a fake.,m
You really think I'm crazy_ don't you?,m
David_ please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.,m
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.,m
I really don't know.,m
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?,m
No. In fact_ your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.,m
Did you see Jack?,m
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.,m
Look_ Dr. Hirsch_ I know I've been traumatized_ but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.,m
Yes.,m
I've told you_ it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.,m
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?,m
Sure_ as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.,m
You've never had bad dreams before?,m
Doctor_ my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.,m
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.,m
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.,m
So they said.,m
There were witnesses?,m
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative_ so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.,m
Lunatic?,m
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises_ lost a bit of blood_ but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.,m
Two weeks?,m
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.,m
How long have I been here?,m
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?,m
Miss Price! Miss Price_ please!,m
Now_ David_ I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.,m
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?,m
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.,m
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.,m
You're in a hospital in London.,m
Where am I?,m
Hello_ David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours_ Mr. Collins.,m
If you did it wrong_ it would be painful. You'd choke to death.,m
I could hang myself.,m
How shall I do it?,m
Because this must be stopped.,m
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.,m
Hello.,m
David Kessler_ this is Gerald Bringsly.,m
I want you to meet some people.,m
Well_ even if I'm not the wolfman_ I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean_ here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you_ Jack.,m
What about the zoo?,m
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.,m
Thank you.,m
You look awful.,m
If I was still alive_ I probably would.,m
Aren't you going to say_ 'I told you so'?,m
You don't have to say anything.,m
What can I say_ Jack?,m
Hi_ David.,m
Hi_ Jack.,m
I will not accept this! Now go away!,m
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit_ David_ please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time_ David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!,m
What_ Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!,m
You must believe me.,m
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.,m
What do you think?,m
Jack_ are you really dead?,m
You must take your own life now_ David_ before it's too late.,m
A monster. I know_ I know.,m
David_ tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change_ you'll become...,m
Get out of here_ Jack!,m
Yes.,m
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.,m
David_ I'm sorry I upset you yesterday_ but you must understand what is going on.,m
Okay_ you've seen me. Now go away.,m
I wanted to see you.,m
What are you doing here?,m
Don't be an asshole_ David. Come here.,m
You're not real.,m
It's cold_ David_ and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself_ David_ before you kill others.,m
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!,m
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide_ David. Join me.,m
Nurse!,m
Listen to me! Take your own life_ David. It's our only chance.,m
Nurse!,m
David_ please believe me. You will kill people_ David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.,m
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!,m
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.,m
Jack_ please go away. Please go away.,m
Beware the moon. The full moon_ David. You've got two days.,m
Stop it_ Jack.,m
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.',m
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!,m
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.,m
What?!,m
It's you_ David.,m
Will you be quiet?!,m
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.,m
What's wrong with you? Shut up!,m
I was murdered_ an unnatural death_ and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.,m
Shut up_ you zombie!,m
On the moors_ we were attacked by a lycanthrope_ a werewolf.,m
I'm not listening!,m
We were attacked by a werewolf.,m
If you love me so much_ Jack_ you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!,m
I'm a grisly sight_ it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.,m
Warn me? Will you get out of here_ you meat loaf?,m
David_ now I know this may be hard for you_ but I have to warn you.,m
What?!,m
David!,m
I'm going completely crazy.,m
Life mocks me even in death.,m
Rudy Levine the shmuck?,m
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.,m
I can't stand it.,m
Debbie Klein cried a lot.,m
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.,m
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.,m
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?,m
I'm sorry to be upsetting you_ David_ but I had to come.,m
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me_ I'm talking to a hamburger!,m
David! You're hurting my feelings.,m
I'm aware that I don't look so great_ but I thought you'd be glad to see me.,m
This is too much. I can't handle this.,m
Thanks a lot.,m
Get the fuck out of here_ Jack.,m
Nice to see you.,m
Are you going to help me up?,m
You really scared me_ you shithead.,m
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!,m
I'll tell you when we get there.,m
Where are we going?,m
Yeah.,m
Jack?,m
Not far enough. Come on.,m
It sounds far away.,m
No.,m
See anything?,m
Walking away_ yes_ sir. Here we are walking away.,m
Walk away_ Jack.,m
Nice doggie. Good boy.,m
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.,m
Oh shit. What is that?,m
Do you think it's a dog?,m
It's in front of us.,m
Let's just keep walking.,m
Plan?,m
What's the plan?,m
It's circling us.,m
It's moving.,m
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.,m
Come on_ where?,m
I don't know. Come on.,m
Shit! David_ what is that?,m
Yeah.,m
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.,m
It's a full moon_ 'beware the moon'.,m
No_ but he was on the moors.,m
Heathcliffe didn't howl.,m
Heathcliffe.,m
Pecos Bill.,m
The Hound of the Baskervilles.,m
There aren't any coyotes in England.,m
A coyote.,m
Yeah?,m
Could be a lot of things.,m
What was it?,m
I heard that.,m
Did you hear that?,m
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.,m
Say_ David...,m
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it_ because they felt so silly.,m
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.,m
I have no idea.,m
What do you think was wrong?,m
Well_ not quite a blood-thirsty mob.,m
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees_ I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.,m
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.,m
Come on_ I'm freezing.,m
Beware the moon?,m
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.,m
What the hell was that all about?,m
Apparently so.,m
Come on_ Jack_ shall we go?!!,m
What do you mean? I'm starving.,m
Jack_ we'd better go.,m
You ask them.,m
Go on_ ask them.,m
Wrong.,m
Right.,m
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.,m
Listen_ that's a pentangle_ a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney_ Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.,m
You ask them.,m
Ask them what the candles are for.,m
Maybe the owners are from Texas.,m
It's a five-pointed star.,m
What about it?,m
Look at that.,m
Listen_ at least it's warm in here.,m
Nice looking group.,m
Nice to see you.,m
Hello.,m
Shall we?,m
Okay.,m
I assume full responsibility.,m
David_ before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.,m
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.,m
That's not a spear. It's a pike.,m
Of course_ The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?,m
That's a wolf's head.,m
Of course_ The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?,m
The Slaughtered Lamb?,m
She says she 'likes me too much'.,m
We've known Debbie what_ since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?,m
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.,m
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.,m
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.,m
If you don't stop_ I'm going to kill you.,m
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...,m
I don't know.,m
Well_ anyway_ do you think she'll be there?,m
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck_ so give me a break.,m
You're talking about the woman I love.,m
She's a jerk.,m
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.,m
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.,m
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?,m
Right.,m
I'm sorry. Northern England first_ Italy later.,m
Well_ I like it here.,m
Oh_ I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?,m
You're not having a good time are you?,m
David.,m
Jack.,m
Good.,m
Yes.,m
Are you cold?,m
Stay here. If we need you_ we'll know where to reach you.,?
What can we do to assist you?,m
Regardless of what you think_ Lieutenant_ the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.,m
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved_ that's true_ but I hardly think...,?
Why don't we ask him?,m
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?,?
You were saying?,m
Well_ then_ what can I do for Scotland Yard?,m
No_ thank you_ Doctor.,?
Come in_ come in. Please sit. Some tea?,m
Dr. Hirsch?,?
Tell him I'm out. No_ tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!,m
He's on the telephone.,?
What here?,m
Roger Mathison_ Doctor.,?
Excuse me.  Yes?,m
Send them in.,m
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you_ Doctor.,?
Yes?,m
I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?,m
Oh_ that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out_ but it's traditional_ so we left it.,?
What's that?,m
I suppose Guinness will suffice.,m
Sorry_ love.,?
Campari and soda would do nicely.,m
Hello_ there. What can I get you?,?
I beg your pardon?,?
Remember the Alamo?,m
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.,?
Oh.,m
No.,?
Then you have some hot tea?,m
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want_ you can have tea.,?
Hot chocolate?,m
No.,?
Do you have any hot soup?,m
We'll find him_ not to worry.,?
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him_ however. I can assure you of that.,?
That is precisely my point. David_ as far as we are concerned_ the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.,?
I don't rightly know_ sir.,?
And what_ Sergeant?,?
Lieutenant_ the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...,?
Sgt. McManus_ are you suggesting that David and Jack were_ in fact_ attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me_ Mr. Kessler_ if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.,?
He may have a point_ Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.,?
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?,?
Sorry.,?
I'd like some tea_ please.,?
No_ thank you.,?
Yeah - sure!,m
