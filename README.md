# Attribute-Detection-CNN-Model

This Repository consist of four CNN Models that takes user conversation in the form of text to predict the user's hidden attributes mentioned below.

Hidden Attributes are :-
  1 - Gender ( Male / Female )
  2 - Age Category ( Child / Teenager / Adult / Middle-Aged / Senior ) 
  3 - Marital Status ( Single / Married )
  4 - Profession ( Administrator / Assistant / Banker / Doctor / Military Personnel / Musician / Painter / Photographer / Policeman / Priest / Professor / Soldier / Sportsman / Student )
      Note: For the case of Profession, the sub-categories are covered under their super categorical profession names
            E.g: Pianist, Guitarist, Drummer, etc,. are covered under the profession "Musician" and Colonel, Major, Soldier, etc,. are covered under Military Personnel

  #2 Age Category Prediction:
      Run the 'predict_age_group.ipynb' in 'AgeCategory_Classification' folder, it asks for the dialog input for predicting the Age-group and the Output is displayed beneath.
  #3 Marital Status Prediction:
